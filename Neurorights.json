    "Abstract": "In this article, we propose a philosophical exploration on the main problems involved in two neurorights that concern autonomous action, namely free will and cognitive liberty, and sketch a possible solution to these problems by resourcing to a holistic interpretation of human actions. First, we expose the main conceptual and practical issues arising from the neuroright to “free will,” which are far from minor: the term itself is denied by some trends participating in the neurorights debate, the related concept of ultimate control is also disputed, the understanding of free will depends on cultural context, and the exercise of being free to act in several domains may be covered by other regulations. Second, we analyze the historical origin of cognitive liberty, its current status, and its relation with free will. Third, we criticize the concept of decision in mainstream action theory and propose to conceive action as a unified process constituted by three explanatory, non-sequential dimensions: intention, decision, and action realization. Fourth, we discuss two possible cases involving neurotechnologies and suggest ways to interpret them according to a unified framework in which free will and cognitive liberty fall under a single neuroright to personal autonomy. Finally, we outline a recommendation to introduce freedom of thought and personal autonomy as complementary neurorights to protect both the internal and external dimensions of thought and action. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Neuroenthusiasts and neuroskeptics both exaggerate the strength of their positions. Neuroscience is already having a significant impact in the courts in many jurisdictions and as knowledge from the cognitive sciences expands, that knowledge, wherever relevant, should continue to inform legal systems. However, neuroscience will only ever be one influence among many. In certain areas, for example, our understanding of fear responses or the reliability of memory evidence, the cognitive sciences may help challenge errors of folk psychology and assist the law to adopt better approaches. In other areas such as juvenile responsibility, developmental neuroscience may prove decisive in reinforcing messages from educational psychology and the behavioral sciences both in persuading legislators and judges but also importantly in altering public attitudes. Drawing on examples from a range of countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada, England, the Netherlands, Scotland, Slovenia, and the United States, we argue that legal systems must be open to and learn from science and must not be afraid to engage with science even where there is no clear scientific consensus. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The increasing diffusion of novel digital and online sociotechnical systems for arational behavioral influence based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as social media, microtargeting advertising, and personalized search algorithms, has brought about new ways of engaging with users, collecting their data and potentially influencing their behavior. However, these technologies and techniques have also raised concerns about the potential for manipulation, as they offer unprecedented capabilities for targeting and influencing individuals on a large scale and in a more subtle, automated and pervasive manner than ever before. This paper, provides a narrative review of the existing literature on manipulation, with a particular focus on the role of AI and associated digital technologies. Furthermore, it outlines an account of manipulation based of four key requirements: intentionality, asymmetry of outcome, non-transparency and violation of autonomy. I argue that while manipulation is not a new phenomenon, the pervasiveness, automaticity, and opacity of certain digital technologies may raise a new type of manipulation, called “digital manipulation”. I call “digital manipulation” any influence exerted through the use of digital technology that is intentionally designed to bypass reason and to produce an asymmetry of outcome between the data processor (or a third party that benefits thereof) and the data subject. Drawing on insights from psychology, sociology, and computer science, I identify key factors that can make manipulation more or less effective, and highlight the potential risks and benefits of these technologies for individuals and society. I conclude that manipulation through AI and associated digital technologies is not qualitatively different from manipulation through human–human interaction in the physical world. However, some functional characteristics make it potentially more likely of evading the subject’s cognitive defenses. This could increase the probability and severity of manipulation. Furthermore, it could violate some fundamental principles of freedom or entitlement related to a person’s brain and mind domain, hence called neurorights. To this end, an account of digital manipulation as a violation of the neuroright to cognitive liberty is presented. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, there has been increased academic interest in the human right to freedom of thought (RFoT). Scholars from various disciplines are currently debating the content and scope of this right. In his annual thematic report of 2021, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief paid explicit and comprehensive attention to the RFoT, encouraging further clarification of the content and scope of the right. This paper aims to contribute to this end, setting the stage for further research, by offering a multidisciplinary analysis of the RFoT's scope, relation to other rights, practical significance and moral foundations.  © 2022 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Intelligent neurotechnology is an emerging field that combines neurotechnologies like brain-computer interface (BCI) with artificial intelligence. This paper introduces a capability framework to assess the responsible use of intelligent BCI systems and provide practical ethical guidance. It proposes two tests, the threshold and flourishing tests, that BCI applications must meet, and illustrates them in a series of cases. After a brief introduction (Section 1), Section 2 sets forth the capability view and the two tests. It illustrates the threshold test using examples from clinical medicine of BCI applications that enable patients with profound disabilities to function at a threshold level through computer mediation. Section 3 illustrates the flourishing test by exploring possible future applications of BCI involving neuroenhancements for healthy people, using examples adapted from research currently underway in the US military. Section 3 applies a capability lens to a complex case involving dual effects, both therapeutic and non-therapeutic, showing how the threshold and flourishing tests resolve the case. Section 4 replies to three objections: neurorights are the best tool for assessing BCI; the two tests are moving targets; and the analysis utilizes a capability view to do work it is not designed for. The paper concludes that a capability view offers unique advantages and gives practical guidance for evaluating the responsible use of present and future BCI applications. Extrapolating from our analysis may help guide other emerging technologies, such as germline gene editing, expected to impact central human capabilities. © 2022, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Neuromarketing, which aims to understand the neural processes underlying consumer behavior, combines contributions from neuroscience, psychology, and marketing to develop effective strategies that can target consumers' unconscious thoughts and emotions. The goal is to 'brand' the consumer himself, through increasingly in-depth knowledge of his purchasing behavior, interacting directly with the brain, which is the basis of human identity, freedom of thought, free will and privacy. While there are laws to protect privacy and consumer rights, the specific threats related to neurosciences as to defend the 'neurorights' of citizens are not yet regulated, even though the need for appropriate protection is increasingly felt. © 2023, Suor Orsola Benincasa University of Naples.

    "Abstract": "This pilot study investigated legal and non-legal professionals’ decision process during a typical working day. During self-evaluated highly relevant decisions (rated through a daily diary), the two groups were asked to wear the Muse™ Headband to record their electrophysiological (EEG) activity in terms of frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and beta). EEG cognitive findings displayed a generally increased beta power in the anterior frontal region (mainly in the right than left) for both groups during highly relevant decisions. Significantly results were also found for the legal professionals’ group, for which a decrease of alpha power was found in the left compared to right frontal cortex. Furthermore, a decreased alpha power and increased delta and theta power in the right compared to left Temporo-Parietal Junction was observed in the legal professionals when taking highly relevant decisions. This pilot study suggested a specific EEG pattern for legal professionals while taking highly relevant decisions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In the article, ethical conflicts arising from the application of neurotechnologies in the human body were analyzed. Although these external devices were presented as potential solutions to certain pathologies, it was observed that they could also be used in healthy individuals and interfere with brain activity, thereby generating the main concern around neuro-rights. However, to carry out this investigation, the focus was on the mind-brain relationship and moral dilemmas. Finally, a connection was established between neuroscience and Derridean and Nancyan thought. This allowed for an understanding, from an interpretative reading of the French philosopher’s thought, of the interpretation of writing as brain codes and the urgency of legislating neuro-rights in the face of a potentially dangerous future. © 2023; Los autores.",

    "Abstract": "Patents relating to the human brain and its functions regularly fulfil the general patent requirements. In some cases, however, the inventions in question reveal considerable risks for the rights of individuals, but also for society as such, which have a hitherto unknown dimension and which have not been discussed so far. Due to the limited scope of application of the ordre public clause, patent law is fundamentally not in a position to respond adequately to the challenges that exist here. The ratio of patent law and the lack of resources and also, above all, competence of the patent offices for a more extensive ethico-legal analysis mean that patent law is not the right setting for dealing with the existing challenges. Instead, the international organisations responsible for the protection of human rights and their relevant bodies are in particular demand here, although they have so far been unaware of the difficulties that are evident in the area of brain patents. What is needed is the development and establishment of mechanisms that enable the flagging and communication of critical patents, so that the responsible bodies are enabled to fulfil their tasks. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "Funding Texts": "Funding text 1: In recent years, neuroethics and neurolaw have established themselves as disciplines with their own raison d’être. Numerous monographs and journal articles, the activities of the International Neuroethics Society, the investigation of the interdependencies between neuroscientific findings and the US legal system funded by the MacArthur Foundation, and the institutionalised study of ELSA aspects within the framework of both the Human Brain Project and the BRAIN Initiative impressively demonstrate the breadth and depth of the scientific discourse. However, despite these exponentially increasing activities, the implications and challenges of patent law have so far remained almost unnoticed. One could attribute this finding to the fact that brain patents do not represent any special features compared to patents on genes and gene sequences. In fact, this view was held in the early stages of the neuroethical and neuroregulatory discourse. ; Funding text 2: The project (International Neuroethics Patent Initiative, INPI) on which this paper is based was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (funding code 01GP2122) within the framework of ERA-NET NEURON.

    "Abstract": "Autobiographical memories contribute to forming the core of who we are. However, memories of traumatic events can be experienced as a burden. Recent neurotechnology research in-dicates the possibility of selectively dampening or even erasing specific memories. On a personal level, altering even a single memory could lead to significant changes in one’s self-under-standing and psychological continuity, ultimately threatening authenticity. On a collective level, memory dampening and erasure neurotechnology could affect accountability mechanisms (e.g., in witness testimony) and more in general, alter the process of collecting and recollecting society’s historical memory. The question is whether these concerns outweigh the possible mental health benefits to the individual. We argue that the fundamental rights to cognitive liberty and mental health grant a subject the right to decide upon their own memory, within constraints and having met several conditions. © Author (s).",

    "Abstract": "In this article, the authors address some of the most pressing issues that stem from the relationship between the technological advancements of the twenty-first century and legal regulation. The development of neurotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI), while offering considerable opportunities for the betterment of social life, also poses unprecedented risks. These challenges manifest in a wide variety of topics. Areas such as human rights treaties, antitrust law, property law, and labor law are affected by these developments. The risks associated with the unregulated use of neurotechnology and AI do not cease at the sectorial stage. Some of the values upon which current democratic systems and governance models are built could be equally threatened. In anticipation of the harming potential of unmitigated technological advances, some governments and international institutions have enacted legal provisions to regulate the current digital landscape. These normative instruments, including the Chilean Constitutional Amendment and European Charts of Digital Rights, are also analyzed in the following pages.

    "Abstract": "Calls to adopt neurorights in the international human rights framework in order to address the challenges raised by neurotechnology are growing louder. By contrast, various scholars point out that the introduction of such neurorights would be premature considering that the adequacy of existing human rights in addressing these challenges should first be thoroughly investigated. In this analysis, it will be examined whether the existing human rights framework can offer adequate protection against the threats neurotechnology poses to the human mind. First, ongoing developments in neurotechnology will be explored. Second, critical considerations will be formulated regarding the introduction of neurorights. Third, a detailed analysis will be conducted on how existing human rights law might counter the ethical concerns neurotechnology gives rise to. By way of conclusion, it will be argued that, through an evolutive interpretation of its provisions, this framework might already be able to aptly address these concerns. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "This work focuses on the growing interplay between neuroscience and law by outlining issues of criminal responsibility and within the broader framework of epistemological interactions among different fields of knowledge. It illustrates the opportunity to have a peculiar “debate” or dialogue among the considered branches of science and in the single domain of neurolaw. Then, this paper presents the Socratic method as a specific dialectical approach to rationally guide these epistemological connections, to favour the critical comparison of heterogeneous perspectives, and thus to spotlight fertile common spaces where new interdisciplinary knowledge is reachable. Finally, the article considers significant stances in the neurolaw debate to show that, in so far as they are grounded on dialectics and refutation, they can be seen as strong manifestations of a Socratic dialogue. Hence, leveraging this practice, even into the legal systems there is room for neuroscientific evidence and contributions, although this entails a dash of“neuromodesty”, critical thinking, and a plea for the Socratic method. © 2023 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Transhumanism, nowadays, is being incorporated into mass culture due to the fact that an increasing number of scientists are beginning to take very seriously the wide range of possibilities it comprises. The aim of this paper is to present an analysis of the problems and dilemmas faced by bioethics and its aspects in relation to transhumanism, showing the ideas in which convergence and divergence can be seen with respect to achievements and perspectives. It also shows the analysis of the current trends from different perspectives (social, legal, technological, moral, philosophical) in which transhumanism has been positioning itself and generating new panoramas. In the same direction, an aspect derived from such development is presented: neuderlaw, regarding the scope, perspectives and contradictions resulting from the development of neurosciences and their application in the legal field. © 2023, Centro Universitario Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

    "Abstract": "Unprecedented efforts are made to research and develop technologies that are directly connected to the brain and allow us to access, monitor, investigate, assess, manipulate or stimulate neural processes. This exciting development holds many valuable prospects in the medical context and in other fields of daily life such as entertainment, security or criminal justice. However, it also raises major concerns among ethicists and human rights advocates, who argue that fundamental interests are put at risk as these neurotechnologies result in a growing accessibility and influenceability of the mind. In this article, I will describe how neurotechnologies may affect fundamental interests and how this concern led to the emergence of the concept of neurorights within human rights doctrine and policy. I will first outline the current state of the art and the prospects of neurotechnology, and discuss how this technology impacts the mind. Second, I will examine how this in turn may impact our mental privacy, autonomy, authenticity, personal identity, the self, and non-discrimination. Finally, I will show how these concerns prompted initiatives to establish neurorights as new human rights offering appropriate legal safeguards that protect the human mind against unwanted interference by neurotechnology.

    "Abstract": "After reaching the age of criminal responsibility, children are deemed capable of having committed criminal offenses. In this regard, the level of criminal responsibility depends on cognitive development and the type of offense committed. Cognitive development is a process of the growth of perception, thinking and reasoning in children. This concept is frequently referred to in cognitive neuroscience literature. Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Roper v Simmons has substantially changed attitudes toward juvenile delinquency, considering the fact that cognitive development continues until early adulthood. The present study attempts to scrutinize this case and explain cognitive development by its factors from an interdisciplinary perspective, combining methods and theories from neuroscience and criminal law. © 2022 The Australian and New Zealand Association of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law.",

    "Abstract": "This paper discusses a landmark ruling by the Chilean Supreme Court of August 9, 2023 dealing with the right to mental privacy, originated with an action for constitutional protection filed on behalf of Guido Girardi Lavin against Emotiv Inc., a North American company based in San Francisco, California that is commercializing the device “Insight.” This wireless device functions as a headset with sensors that collect information about the brain’s electrical activity (i.e., neurodata). The discussion revolves around whether neurodata can be considered personal data and whether they could be classified into a special category. The application of the present legislation on data (the most obsolete, such as the Chilean law, and the most recent EU law) does not seem adequate to protect neurodata. The use of neurodata raises ethical and legal concerns that are not fully addressed by current regulations on personal data protection. Despite not being necessarily considered personal data, neurodata represent the most intimate aspects of human personality and should be protected in light of potential new risks. The unique characteristics of neurodata, including their interpretive nature and potential for revealing thoughts and intentions, pose challenges for regulation. Current data protection laws do not differentiate between different types of data based on their informational content, which is relevant for protecting individual rights. The development of new technologies involving neurodata requires particular attention and careful consideration to prevent possible harm to human dignity. The regulation of neurodata must account for their specific characteristics and the potential risks they pose to privacy, confidentiality, and individual rights. The answer lies in the reconfiguration of human rights known as “neurorights” that goes beyond the protection of personal data. Copyright © 2024 Cornejo-Plaza, Cippitani and Pasquino.",

    "Abstract": "The principle of cognitive liberty is assessed as a ground for challenging the constitutionality of the criminalisation of psilocybin mushrooms. To do so, s 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, is analysed, determining that s 12(2) is not a numerus clausa and is capable of enforcing further protections and/or entitlements, such as cognitive liberty. Further, it is suggested that the interpretation of s 12(2)(b) offers protection to both body and mind, and as such, also protecting the cognitive liberty right. Having established that the Constitution protects the right afforded by the principle cognitive liberty, it is deduced that the current criminalisation of psilocybin mushrooms–a means through which an individual may exercise their cognitive liberty rights–in terms of the Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act and Medicines and Related Substances Act, conflict with the rights established in s 12 of the Constitution. A s 36 limitation of rights analysis is presented, detailing that the criminalisation of psilocybin mushrooms is not justifiable when the nature and importance of the limited right are weighed against the importance and purpose of the criminalisation. As such, this article concludes that the current criminalising legislation is not justifiable. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Progress in neurotechnology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides unprecedented insights into the human brain. There are increasing possibilities to influence and measure brain activity. These developments raise multifaceted ethical and legal questions. The proponents of neurorights argue in favour of introducing new human rights to protect mental processes and brain data. This article discusses the necessity and advantages of introducing new human rights focusing on the proposed new human right to mental self-determination and the right to freedom of thought as enshrined in Art.18 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and Art. 9 European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). I argue that the right to freedom of thought can be coherently interpreted as providing comprehensive protection of mental processes and brain data, thus offering a normative basis regarding the use of neurotechnologies. Besides, I claim that an evolving interpretation of the right to freedom of thought is more convincing than introducing a new human right to mental self-determination. © 2022, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer perception technologies (e.g., digital phenotyping and affective computing) promise to transform clinical approaches to personalized care in psychiatry and beyond by offering more objective measures of emotional states and behavior, enabling precision treatment, diagnosis, and symptom monitoring. At the same time, passive and continuous nature by which they often collect data from patients in non-clinical settings raises ethical issues related to privacy and self-determination. Little is known about how such concerns may be exacerbated by the integration of neural data, as parallel advances in computer perception, AI, and neurotechnology enable new insights into subjective states. Here, we present findings from a multi-site NCATS-funded study of ethical considerations for translating computer perception into clinical care and contextualize them within the neuroethics and neurorights literatures. Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews with patients (n = 20), caregivers (n = 20), clinicians (n = 12), developers (n = 12), and clinician developers (n = 2) regarding their perspective toward using PC in clinical care. Transcripts were analyzed in MAXQDA using Thematic Content Analysis. Results: Stakeholder groups voiced concerns related to (1) perceived invasiveness of passive and continuous data collection in private settings; (2) data protection and security and the potential for negative downstream/future impacts on patients of unintended disclosure; and (3) ethical issues related to patients’ limited versus hyper awareness of passive and continuous data collection and monitoring. Clinicians and developers highlighted that these concerns may be exacerbated by the integration of neural data with other computer perception data. Discussion: Our findings suggest that the integration of neurotechnologies with existing computer perception technologies raises novel concerns around dignity-related and other harms (e.g., stigma, discrimination) that stem from data security threats and the growing potential for reidentification of sensitive data. Further, our findings suggest that patients’ awareness and preoccupation with feeling monitored via computer sensors ranges from hypo- to hyper-awareness, with either extreme accompanied by ethical concerns (consent vs. anxiety and preoccupation). These results highlight the need for systematic research into how best to implement these technologies into clinical care in ways that reduce disruption, maximize patient benefits, and mitigate long-term risks associated with the passive collection of sensitive emotional, behavioral and neural data.

    "Abstract": "In recent years, neuroscience has been increasingly making its way into law, to the extent that a new name for the field has emerged abroad, referred to as neurolaw. This area of law takes an interdisciplinary approach to different branches of law, focusing on human conduct in the light of new findings in neuroscience. In the Czech environment, however, neurolaw is neglected, despite the fact that the discussions that take place in this field seem to be directly crucial for some areas of law. In fact, neuroscience has cast doubt on the very philosophical foundations of criminal and civil law, especially in the area of the question of the existence of human freedom. This article focuses on selected interesting problems that neuroscience raises in the field of medical law. © 2023, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Institute of State and Law.

    "Abstract": "As we approach an era of potentially widespread consumer neurotechnology, scholars and organizations worldwide have started to raise concerns about the data privacy issues these devices will present. Notably absent in these discussions is empirical evidence about how the public perceives that same information. This article presents the results of a nationwide survey on public perceptions of brain data, to inform discussions of law and policy regarding brain data governance. The survey reveals that the public may perceive certain brain data as less sensitive than other 'private' information, like social security numbers, but more sensitive than some 'public' information, like media preferences. The findings also reveal that not all inferences about mental experiences may be perceived as equally sensitive, and perhaps not all data should be treated alike in ethical and policy discussions. An enhanced understanding of public perceptions of brain data could advance the development of ethical and legal norms concerning consumer neurotechnology.  © 2024 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This article analyzes emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced lie detection systems from ethical and human resource (HR) management perspectives. I show how these AI enhancements transform lie detection, followed with analyses as to how the changes can lead to moral problems. Specifically, I examine how these applications of AI introduce human rights issues of fairness, mental privacy, and bias and outline the implications of these changes for HR management. The changes that AI is making to lie detection are altering the roles of human test administrators and human subjects, adding machine learning-based AI agents to the situation and establishing invasive data collection processes as well as introducing certain biases in results. I project that the potentials for pervasive and continuous lie detection initiatives (“truth machines”) are substantial, displacing human-centered efforts to establish trust and foster integrity in organizations. I argue that if it is possible for HR managers to do so, they should cease using technologically-based lie detection systems entirely and work to foster trust and accountability on a human scale. However, if these AI-enhanced technologies are put into place by organizations by law, agency mandate, or other compulsory measures, care should be taken that the impacts of the technologies on human rights and wellbeing are considered. The article explores how AI can displace the human agent in some aspects of lie detection and credibility assessment scenarios, expanding the prospects for inscrutable, “black box” processes and novel physiological constructs (such as “biomarkers of deceit”) that may increase the potential for such human rights concerns as fairness, mental privacy, and bias. Employee interactions with autonomous lie detection systems rather with than human beings who administer specific tests can reframe organizational processes and rules concerning the assessment of personal honesty and integrity. The dystopian projection of organizational life in which analyses and judgments of the honesty of one’s utterances are made automatically and in conjunction with one’s personal profile provides unsettling prospects for the autonomy of self-representation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This collection presents a comparative perspective on interdisciplinary issues that fall under the emerging field of Neurolaw. The chapters embrace distinct procedural and evidential issues in the courtroom for vulnerable defendants, such as immature defendants, mentally disordered offenders and unfit-to-plead defendants, through a neuroscientific lens. This view is informed by worldwide analyses from legal academics, philosophers, and legal practitioners. The work brings together interdisciplinary and leading perspectives to discuss the use and relevancy of neuroscience at trial, and how the use of neuroscience is currently benefiting and impacting vulnerable defendants in global criminal trials. As such, the book builds upon and adds to the existing literature in this field by providing a comprehensive coverage of the intersection between these disciplines for vulnerable defendants in the courtroom. Key issues covered include: vulnerable defendants and the pre-trial process; the trial process; the use of neuroscience as expert evidence at trial; and vulnerable defendants, neuroscience and mitigation of sentence. Through original exploration presented by contributors from both academia and practice, the book will be of interest to academics, researchers and policy-makers working in the areas of Criminal Law and Procedure. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Hannah Wishart and Colleen M.

    "Abstract": "Dorado Montero has often been misunderstood and some scholars have attributed to him certain meanings or whole ideas which he never expressed. According to my understanding, the classification of Dorado Montero followed three ‘waves’. In the first wave, Dorado Montero was simply included within the positivists. He was lumped together with Lombroso, Ferri and Garofalo. Sometime after, the second wave tried to bring Dorado Montero back to the neoclassical postulates (López-Rey easily fits in this wave). Finally, a current third wave tried to draw him back to positivism. Whether this was due to the rise of neuroscience, biological sciences and new disciples as ‘neurolaw’, I cannot possibly conform to fully discredit and underestimate this third wave. Dorado Montero was very much confident when he deliberately denied freewill. Besides, the influence he had in other authors and posterior schools is mentioned (Bernaldo de Quirós is particularly relevant). Nevertheless, it can be asserted that Dorado Montero has been simplistically ascribed within Italian positivism. That is why it is more adequate to label his thought as simply Doradian, since the number of nuances prevent him from being included within one group. Dorado Montero did not articulate a practical model. The theory he maintained did not become a real system, other than perhaps the main ideas behind the indeterminate sentence. His thought amounted to a profoundly theoretical approach, yet very ambitious, almost utopian. The several proposals he attempted to provide were not applicable neither to the historical and political reality of his time nor nowadays. After a scrutiny of his works, the reader might have the impression that he is still owed a clear proposal. Besides, the systems he drafted, were so abstract that the longed solution to the unfair system of Criminal law back on his time could not be found. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",

    "Abstract": "Crime comes with enormous costs, not only financial but also in terms of loss of mental and physical health and, in some cases, even loss of life. Recidivism is responsible for a considerable percentage of the crimes, and therefore, society deems reducing recidivism a priority. To reduce recidivism, several types of interventions can be used, such as education and employment-focused rehabilitation programs which are intended to improve psychological and social factors. Another way to prevent reoffending is to influence the offender's brain functions. For example, medication can be offered to treat delusions or to diminish sexual drive. In the near future, innovative neurotechnologies are expected to improve prediction and prevention of reoffending. Potential positive effects of such neurotechniques include a safer society and earlier release of prisoners who are no longer “at high risk” to relapse into criminal behavior. Meanwhile, employing these neurotechniques in the criminal justice system raises fundamental concerns, for example, about autonomy, privacy and mental integrity. This chapter aims to identify some of the ethical and legal challenges of using neurotechnologies to reduce recidivism. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Digital health applications include a wide range of wearable, implantable, injectable and ingestible digital medical devices. Many of these devices use machine learning algorithms to assist medical prognosis and decision-making. One of the most compelling digital medical device developments is brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) which entails the connecting of a person's brain to a computer, or to another device outside the human body. BCIs allow bidirectional communication and control between the human brain and the outside world by exporting brain data or altering brain activity. Although being marveled at for its clinical promises, this technological advancement also raises novel ethical, legal, social and technical implications (ELSTI). Debates in this regard centers around patient autonomy, equity, trustworthiness in healthcare, data protection and security, risks of dehumanization, the limitations of machine learning-based decision-making, and the influence that BCIs have on what it means to be human and human rights. Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) after World War II, the landscape that give rise to these human rights has evolved enormously. Human life and humans' role in society are being transformed and threatened by technologies that were never imagined at the time the UDHR was adopted. BCIs, in particular, harbor the greatest possibility of social and individual disruption through its capability to record, interpret, manipulate, or alter brain activity that may potentially alter what it means to be human and how we control humans in future. Cutting edge technological innovations that increasingly blur the lines between human and computer beg the rethinking and extension of existing human rights to remain relevant in a digitized world. In this paper sui generis human rights such as mental privacy, the right to identity or self, agency or free will and fair access to cognitive augmentation will be discussed and how a regulatory framework must be adapted to act as technology enablers, whilst ensuring fairness, accountability, and transparency in sociotechnical systems. © 2022 ACM.",

    "Abstract": "In 2021, 193 Member States at UNESCO’s General Conference adopted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence as the first important step towards a future global standard-setting instrument on the subject. The text reflects an emerging consensus among the international community about the growing ethical concerns with artificial intelligence (AI). Among these concerns are also serious risks and dangers attributed to the manipulative effects of AI, which can be further exacerbated by the creative combination of AI with other innovative technologies or applications, such as brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), robotics, and big data. The risks for individuals and society as a whole caused by manipulation through AI are already well known and have recently also been addressed by the European Union having released a proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). Among multiple risks related to AI, the AIA singles out the specific dangers related to AI systems that deploy “subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness to materially distort a person’s behaviour in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm”. The present article thus aims to highlight the known and potential dangers related to AI systems manipulating human thoughts and behaviour through subliminal and supraliminal means and methods. To this end, it advocates the joint study of law and the senses captured by the concept of legal synaesthesia to correspond to the need for an interdisciplinary debate covering the complexity of the links between AI, related technologies, human perception based on the senses and the mind, as well as the role and instruments of law in the future organization of societies in this world. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "This article examines the role that Criminal Law should play in regulating the non-therapeutic use of immersive Virtual Reality (VR), specifically its massive use by consumers. The starting point has been to consider VR as an intermediate risk scenario, for the purposes of Criminal Law, between the criminality entirely generated in the physical world and that developed in the 2D digital environments [cybercrimes and criminality linked to social networks and persuasive Artificial Intelligence (AI)]. Firstly, specialize literature has been analyzed to establish the nature of virtual reality. From a technical standpoint, virtual reality is a neurotechnology infused with high-risk artificial intelligence; an inseparable synthesis of non-invasive neurotechnology and a set of AI systems, considered high-risk for the fundamental rights of citizens. From the perspective of its functioning, VR is a “transformative” neurotechnology capable of altering what people perceive as reality. This is possible, because its realism lies in the emotional immersion of the user in the virtual experience, similarly to how our brain functions. Therefore, the key idea in the immersive functioning of virtual reality is its capacity to evoke and modify human emotions, which results its greater harmful potential compared to the 2D environment. From there, three central and specific areas of (legally unaddressed) risk arise: (1) the special comprehensive nature of the data collected and stored during its use; (2) its ability to mentally reproduce the “physical” experience of the avatar in the user; and (3) its significant capacity to manipulate individuals. Secondly, the paper examines both the reported cases and the foreseeable criminality in virtual worlds or “proto-metaverse,” focusing on the three risk areas, and exemplifying them with attacks on mental privacy, sexual freedom, and consumer manipulation. Finally, it is proposed that Criminal Law should also intervene (as soon as possible) to define the “red lines” of massive virtual reality use by citizens. With a democratic and human-centered approach, a basic legal framework is outlined for the criminalization of specific harms and risks associated with virtual reality, adapting the existing legal framework as necessary.

    "Abstract": "The development and use of advanced and innovative neuroscience, neurotechnology and some forms of artificial intelligence have exposed potential threats to the human condition, including human rights. As a result, reconceptualizing or creating human rights (i.e. neurorights) has been proposed to address specific brain and mind issues like free will, personal identity and cognitive liberty. However, perceptions, interpretations and meanings of these issues—and of neurorights—may vary between countries, contexts and cultures, all relevant for an international-consensus definition and implementation of neurorights. Thus, we encourage reflecting on the proactive inclusion of transnational, cross-cultural and contextual considerations and concerns to contribute to the global discourse. This inclusion does not mean endorsing ethical relativism but rather a call to foster a universal understanding of key concepts and concerns. Including contextual and cultural perspectives may truly anticipate global concerns which could be addressed while developing and implementing neurorights. Consequently, any ethical and/or legal regulatory framework(s) for the translational and transnational use of advanced neuroscience, neurotechnology and some forms of artificial intelligence intended to protect and safeguard human dignity should be contextually and culturally mindful, responsible, respectful and inclusive of not only human rights and fundamental freedoms but also of neurocognitive cultural diversity. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Several authors have recently claimed that we each possess a right against interference with our minds. However, it remains unclear how this claim is to be justified. I offer a novel argument in defence of it. The argument is intuitive—appealing centrally to intuitions regarding cases—and abductive—taking the form of an inference to the best explanation; I offer a series of cases involving intuitively wrongful interventions, argue that five somewhat promising attempts to account for the wrongfulness of these interventions leave some of this wrongfulness unexplained, and show that my proposed alternative explanation, which invokes a right against mental interference, can account for this residual wrongfulness. © The Author(s) 2024.",

    "Abstract": "In criminal justice systems, after reaching the initial age there are levels of responsibility dictated by the intellectual development and the type of offense committed. Criminal perception, as intellectual ability, is a factor involved in determining the appropriate way to discipline, punish, or rehabilitate a delinquent child. A child’s perception of his/her crime committed, therefore, explicitly or implicitly plays a crucial role in juror decision-making when determining the level of criminal responsibility. Generally, perception refers to the cognitive process of the brain by which it is possible to interpret our surroundings with stimuli. Hence, in the context of neurolaw criminal perception can be defined as an ability that makes it possible for a child to understand criminal situations and behave lawfully. The present study strives to explain the nature of this concept and illustrate its components in light of theories of cognitive neuroscience, ethics, and law. In addition to significantly filling the theoretical gaps in the field at hand, this study provides judges with a new approach regarding children’s criminal perception. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In the article ‘Towards new human rights in the age of neuroscience and neurotechnology’, published in 2017, Ienca and Andorno review the current stage of neuroscience and neurotechnology development, proposing four new human rights that shall protect the individual from the dangers arising from said development. The authors accept the idea of infiltration into our interior castle–the mind–requiring only the proper level of protection against the described probable misuse of techniques, especially their use against the individual’s will. Although their proposal seems a needed addition to the human rights system, it raises doubts as to the very definition of human it was designed to protect. Is the whole concept of the technical infiltration of the brain to alter the mind processes reconcilable with human freedom, especially with freedom of thought, conscience, and religion? In the article, the authors deliberate the inadequacy of two visions of human: the one that was the foundation of the human rights system and another emerging from Ienca and Andorno’s article. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "Everyday Augmented Reality (AR) displays, with wearable, fashionable, all-day form factors, may one day supplant our reliance on physical displays, heralding new capabilities in augmented intelligence and perception, communication, productivity, and more. Such technology has the potential to become as fundamental to our daily lives as smartphones are today, empowering users, communities, business, governments, and others to alter, augment, diminish or otherwise mediate our perception of reality. For social good, this technology can enable augmenting expression of social identity to better represent our 'authentic' self, and virtually enhancing real-world social spaces to encourage greater community ownership and social cohesion. For social harm however, everyday AR could facilitate and amplify manipulation, information disorder (e.g. dis-information), censorship and coercion in our day-to-day experience of reality. In this essay, we consider some of the key societal changes (and ethical challenges) posed by the adoption of everyday AR, and argue that everyday AR will provoke the need for new human rights to be considered alongside proposed neurorights and existing and envisaged digital human rights, around: who can mediate reality (perceptual autonomy); what elements of reality are permissible to alter/augment (perceptual agency); and governing permissible intent regarding why we augment the user's perception of reality, in particular considering tensions in cognitive autonomy (e.g. manipulation) and perceptual integrity (e.g. information disorder). © 2023 ACM.",

    "Abstract": "A brain–computer interface that decodes continuous language from non-invasive recordings would have many scientific and practical applications. Currently, however, non-invasive language decoders can only identify stimuli from among a small set of words or phrases. Here we introduce a non-invasive decoder that reconstructs continuous language from cortical semantic representations recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Given novel brain recordings, this decoder generates intelligible word sequences that recover the meaning of perceived speech, imagined speech and even silent videos, demonstrating that a single decoder can be applied to a range of tasks. We tested the decoder across cortex and found that continuous language can be separately decoded from multiple regions. As brain–computer interfaces should respect mental privacy, we tested whether successful decoding requires subject cooperation and found that subject cooperation is required both to train and to apply the decoder. Our findings demonstrate the viability of non-invasive language brain–computer interfaces. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "This paper argues that calls for neurorights propose an overcomplicated approach. It does this through analysis of ‘rights’ using the influential framework provided by Wesley Hohfeld, whose analytic jurisprudence is still well regarded in its clarificatory approach to discussions of rights. Having disentangled some unclarities in talk about rights, the paper proposes the idea of ‘novel human rights’ is not appropriate for what is deemed worth protecting in terms of mental integrity and cognitive liberty. That is best thought of in terms of Hohfeld’s account of ‘right’ as privilege. It goes on to argue that as privileges, legal protections are not well suited to these cases. As such, they cannot be ‘novel human rights’. Instead, protections for mental integrity and cognitive liberty are best accounted for in terms of familiar and established rational and discursive norms. Mental integrity is best thought of as evaluable in terms of familiar rational norms, and cognitive freedom is constrained by appraisals of sense-making. Concerns about how neurotechnologies might pose particular challenges to mental integrity and cognitive liberty are best protected through careful use of existing legislation on data protection, not novel rights, as it is via data that risks to integrity and liberty are manifested. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The military applications of AI raise myriad ethical challenges. Critical among them is how AI integrates with human decision making to enhance cognitive performance on the battlefield. AI applications range from augmented reality devices to assist learning and improve training to implantable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) to create bionic “super soldiers.” As these technologies mature, AI-wired warfighters face potential affronts to cognitive liberty, psychological and physiological health risks and obstacles to integrating into military and civil society during their service and upon discharge. Before coming online and operational, however, AI-assisted technologies and neural interfaces require extensive research and human experimentation. Each endeavor raises additional ethical concerns that have been historically ignored thereby leaving military and medical scientists without a cogent ethics protocol for sustainable research. In this way, this paper is a “prequel” to the current debate over enhancement which largely considers neuro-technologies once they are already out the door and operational. To lay the ethics foundation for AI-assisted warfighter enhancement research, we present an historical overview of its technological development followed by a presentation of salient ethics research issues (ICRC, 2006). We begin with a historical survey of AI neuro-enhancement research highlighting the ethics lacunae of its development. We demonstrate the unique ethical problems posed by the convergence of several technologies in the military research setting. Then we address these deficiencies by emphasizing how AI-assisted warfighter enhancement research must pay particular attention to military necessity, and the medical and military cost-benefit tradeoffs of emerging technologies, all attending to the unique status of warfighters as experimental subjects. Finally, our focus is the enhancement of friendly or compatriot warfighters and not, as others have focused, enhancements intended to pacify enemy warfighters.

    "Abstract": "Novel usages of brain stimulation combined with artificially intelligent (AI) systems promise to address a large range of diseases. These new conjoined technologies, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI), are increasingly used in experimental and clinical settings to predict and alleviate symptoms of various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Due to their reliance on AI algorithms for feature extraction and classification, these BCI systems enable a novel, unprecedented, and direct connection between human cognition and artificial information processing. In this paper, we present the results of a study that investigates the phenomenology of human-machine symbiosis during a first-in-human experimental BCI trial designed to predict epileptic seizures. We employed qualitative semi-structured interviews to collect user experience data from a participant over a six-years period. We report on a clinical case where a specific embodied phenomenology emerged: namely, after BCI implantation, the patient reported experiences of increased agential capacity and continuity; and after device explantation, the patient reported persistent traumatic harms linked to agential discontinuity. To our knowledge, this is the first reported clinical case of a patient experiencing persistent agential discontinuity due to BCI explantation and potential evidence of an infringement on patient right, where the implanted person was robbed of her de novo agential capacities when the device was removed. © 2023 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Neurointerventions—interventions that physically or chemically modulate brain states—are sometimes imposed on criminal offenders for the purposes of diminishing the risk that they will recidivate, or, more generally, of facilitating their rehabilitation. One objection to the nonconsensual implementation of such interventions holds that this expresses a disrespectful message, and is thus impermissible. In this paper, we respond to this objection, focusing on the most developed version of it—that presented by Elizabeth Shaw. We consider a variety of messages that might be expressed by nonconsensual neurointerventions. Depending on the message, we argue either that such interventions do not invariably express this message, that expressing this message is not invariably disrespectful, or that the appeal to disrespect is redundant. © 2021, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Background. Recently, the academic world has established a series of reconfigurations of emerging human rights, in order to safeguard the mental integrity of people exposed to neurotechnologies. The recommendations of different stakeholders and a literature review support regulation of these technologies. There are different proposals for regulation, some in soft law and others in objective law. The type of regulation chosen can have repercussions on clinical practice, research, and public policy. The constitutional enactment of neurorights in Chile has been criticized in the academic fields of neuroethics and law as having potential negative effects on mental health research. Objective. To analyze in light of the available literature whether the construction of neurorights could create ethical conflicts in the field of mental health, or if it could offer protection against the disruptive use of various neurotechnologies. Method. This analysis included a narrative review of studies included in the PsycInfo, Springer, JSTOR, Medline, Scopus, PubMed, CINALH, and Web of Science databases, without restrictions on language or year of publication. Results. The enactment of neurorights as hard law is found not to be detrimental to the field of mental health. Discussion and conclusion. This article argues that the regulation of neurorights does not threaten the framework of an ecosystem that uses neurotechnologies. On the contrary, such regulation offers protections to people within the complex system of neurotechnologies. © 2023",

    "Abstract": "Crime is a complex phenomenon involving many factors, among which are situational and societal factors. What counts as a crime may also vary across space and time. Often, it is the interplay of several factors that may lead to criminal behavior. Scientifically, brain function is important to consider, first of all because the brain is central to behavior as such, including criminal behavior. Second, because there is increasing evidence for the relevance of specific brain dysfunctions in some criminal behavior, particularly developmental findings related to nonadaptive behavior. Many of our behavioral tendencies are rooted in our childhood (experiences), and this, it appears, is also, at least to some extent, true for nonadaptive behavior. This chapter considers several overarching issues regarding the relationship between—and the science of—brain and crime, some from a conceptual, some from a legal, and others from a developmental perspective. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "This magnetic resonance imaging study is designed to obtain relevant implications for criminal justice and explores the effective connectivity underlying expertise. Laypersons and experts considered sentences for remorseful and remorseless defendants, respectively, with and without mitigation, in hypothetical murder cases. Two groups revealed no differential activation. However, dynamic causal modeling analysis found distinct patterns of connectivity associated with subjects' expertise and mitigating factors. In sentencing for remorseful defendants, laypersons showed increased strength in all bidirectional connections among activated regions of Brodmann area (BA) 32, BA23, the right posterior insula, and the precuneus. In contrast, legal experts sentenced based on mitigation reasoning, showed increased strength only in the bidirectional connection between the insula and the precuneus. When sentencing for remorseless ones without mitigation, both laypersons and experts increased the connection strength, but with reverse directionality, between regions; legal experts strengthened connectivity from BA10 to other regions, that is, the right anterior insula and BA23, but the directionality was reversed in laypersons. In addition, the strength of connection to BA32 and BA10 was correlated with changes in punishments by mitigating factors. This is a crucial result that establishes the validity of the connectivity estimates, which were uninformed by the independent (behavioral) differences in the severity of punishment.  © 2022 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "With the advancement of neurolaw and the discovery of new secrets of the brain, criminal justice systems have made significant progress in justice, employing neuroscience findings. A crucial application of neuroscience techniques in the Islamic criminal law system is to explain the dimensions of human free will from the perspective of neuropsychology, which in addition to creating a new approach to defining this element of criminal responsibility, can ensure the free will of the accused during the commitment of the crime. For this purpose, the current research is an attempt to answer these questions in the framework of Iran's criminal justice system: what is free will from the perspective of Islamic neurolaw, and what are the causes of the loss of free will? This article strives to take an appropriate step towards the development of criminal justice, and introduces Islamic neurolaw. In this study we found that mental disorders, coercion, emergency, drunkenness, somnambulism, and error are the core causes that can be assessed in specific ways using EEG and fMRI techniques, although each has limitations. © 2023",

    "Abstract": "It has been recently suggested that if the Extended Mind thesis is true, mental privacy might be under serious threat. In this paper, I look into the details of this claim and propose that one way of dealing with this emerging threat requires that data ontology be enriched with an additional kind of data—viz., mental data. I explore how mental data relates to both data and metadata and suggest that, arguably, and by contrast with these existing categories of informational content, mental data should not be merely legally protected. Rather, if we value mental privacy as we know it, technological measures should be employed to ensure that one’s mental data are practically—not just legally—impossible for others to obtain. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "The increasing digitalization of today’s society is giving rise to new problems to which the law has to provide answers; the traditional syllogistic techniques in which it is sufficient to apply a clear and precise rule to more or less simple situations described in the rule are no longer useful. This leads to the application of regulatory techniques used, until now, basically in the field of economics. The aim is to protect the rights of individuals in new situations in which digital technologies make it more difficult to predetermine in the rules what conduct is permitted or prohibited. It also seeks to protect democracy itself and the functioning of an economic system in which free and fair competition is an essential element. The first regulatory legal responses to the inevitable process of digitalization of today’s society are to be found in the field of data protection; but these are being followed by those relating to artificial intelligence or the so-called neuro-rights, among others. This extension of regulatory techniques into areas other than the economic sphere implies a transformation of the law. Transformation of public law first of all by entrusting independent administrative authorities with the supervision, monitoring and control of respect for rules and principles in matters such as freedom of expression and opinion, information, privacy, etc., without forgetting the final frontiers of a possible transparency of our behavior and feelings based on access to the brain’s neuronal system. But this also affects private and commercial law insofar as aspects such as identity, name, inheritance, advertising or the marketing of goods and services are affected by the monopolistic possession of data. The interference of the new independent administrative authorities is determined especially by the increasingly intense appeal and referral-from the rules and principles of law-to sciences, knowledge or practices alien (aliunde) to the law, although metabolized by it. It is this alienness that requires recourse to administrative agencies made up not only of jurists, but also of experts in other sciences or knowled-ge, who will end up paving the way and conditioning the answers that judges and magistrates will finally give in the processes and conflicts between parties that are submitted to their knowledge. © 2023, UNIV CARLOSIII MADRID.

    "Abstract": "Past research showed that the ability to focus on one’s internal states (e.g., interoceptive ability) positively correlates with the self-regulation of behavior in situations that are accompanied by somatic and/or physiological changes, such as emotions, physical workload, and decision-making. The analysis of moral oriented decision-making can be the first step for better understanding the legal reasoning carried on by the main players in the field, as lawyers are. For this reason, this study investigated the influence of the decision context and interoceptive manipulation on the moral decision-making process in the legal field gathering the responses of two groups of lawyers. A total of 20 lawyers were randomly divided into an experimental group (EXP), which was explicitly required to focus the attention on its interoceptive correlates, and a control group (CON), which only received the general instruction to perform the task. Both groups underwent a modified version of the Ultimatum Game (UG), where are presented three different moral conditions (professional, company, and social) and three different offers (fair, unfair, and equal). Results highlighted a significant increase of Acceptance Rate (AR) in those offers that should be considered more equal than fair or unfair ones, associated with a general increase of Reaction Times (RTs) in the equal offers. Furthermore, the interoceptive manipulation oriented the Lawyers toward a more self-centered decision. This study shows how individual, situational, contextual, and interoceptive factors may influence the moral decision-making of lawyers. Future research in the so-called Neurolaw field is needed to replicate and expand current findings. Copyright © 2022 Angioletti, Tormen and Balconi.",

    "Abstract": "Thomas Aquinas holds that the actual content of our thought is not directly accesible for any creature, and that free will cannot be superseded. These theses are founded on the spiritual condition of our intelligence and will. On the other hand, he enthrones the will as the keeper of interiority: it precludes a full transparency that would make our free decision to communicate superfluous, and it exert an inalienable control over the action through which we direct ourselves to the good. In this sense, Aquinas departs from reductionist accounts, which either refuse the existence of free will, suppressing the reason to protect its expression, or face the difficulty of explaining the meaning and justification of the rights that are claimed for free will. However, Thomas Aquinas admits the possibility of indirectly accessing our minds through the knowledge of brain states and of influencing our will through passions by means of alterations of our organisms. Although this possibility was not within the reach of the human being in his time, he considered it was within the reach of separated substances. The consideration of the limits of their perspicacity and control sheds light on the possibilities that neurotechnology can allow in the future. The existence of an unassailable stronghold that guarantees our interiority and free will legitimates our right to be respected but does not make their protection superfluous. © 2023 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

    "Abstract": "As scholars envision a new regulatory or statutory neurorights schema it is important to imagine unintended consequences if reforms are implemented before their implications are fully understood. This paper critically evaluates provisions proposed for a new Chilean Constitution and evaluates this movement against efforts to improve the diagnosis of, and treatment for, individuals with disorders of consciousness within the broader context of disability law, international human rights, and a capabilities approach to health justice as advanced by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. Framed in this way, any neurorights regime would need to satisfy several criteria. First it would be obliged to balance both positive and negative rights in the furtherance of human capabilities. Second, it would need to be future oriented and informed about the science it sought to regulate and not fall prey to science fiction fantasies that remain ungrounded in reality. Third, it would need to be specific and avoid generalizations that would lead to conceptual confusion and litigation that could delay scientific progress. Finally, it would need to harmonize novel neurorights with long-established norms in international disability and human rights law. A failure to meet these criteria will destine any novel neurorights regime to the periphery. At this juncture Chile’s nascent constitutional venture into neurorights fails to satisfy these criteria. While there yet may be a role for a more capacious and bivalent articulation of neurorights that account for capabilities and precedent, the current Chilean neurorights reforms are vague and premature. As such they should undergo additional scholarly scrutiny and should not be adopted by other jurisdictions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Today, with the development of neuroscience and the discovery of new secrets of the brain, the social sciences, including law, have made significant progress with the help of new findings in this science. One of the significant applications of neuroscience in modern criminal law is the explanation of the neurological dimensions of human free will, which in addition to creating a profound and scientific approach to the definition of this important element of criminal responsibility, can help ascertain the loss of free will causes. To this end, the present study is an attempt to answer this question in the context of the Iranian criminal justice system: What are the core causes of the loss of free will from the perspective of neurolaw? The paper strives to take an appropriate step toward the development of criminal justice. In this study, we found that mental disorders, coercion, drunkenness, somnambulism, and error are the core causes that can be assessed in particular ways using EEG and fMRI techniques, however, each with limitations. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "Abstract": "The important question of the legality of the state obliging trial incompetent defendants to receive competency-restoring treatment against their wishes, is one that has received much attention by legal scholars. Surprisingly, however, little attention has been paid to the, in many ways more fundamental, moral question of whether the state ought to administer such treatments. The aim of this paper is to start filling this gap in the literature. I begin by offering some reasons for thinking it morally acceptable to, at least sometimes, oblige trial-incompetent defendants to receive competency-restoring treatments. The paper then discusses whether three prominent arguments (and their variations) offered by legal scholars against using non-consensual treatment to restore trial competence provide grounds for thinking there to be a general moral prohibition against these treatments. I argue that they do not. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

    "Abstract": "International institutions such as UNESCO are deliberating on a new standard setting instrument for neurotechnologies. This will likely lead to the adoption of a soft law document which will be the first global document specifically tailored to neurotechnologies, setting the tone for further international or domestic regulations. While some stakeholders have been consulted, these developments have so far evaded the broader attention of the neuroscience, neurotech, and neuroethics communities. To initiate a broader debate, this target article puts to discussion twenty-five considerations and desiderata for recognition by a future instrument. They are formulated at different levels of abstraction, from the big picture to technical details, seek to widen the perspective of preparatory reports and transcend the narrow debate about “neurorights” which overshadows many richer and more relevant aspects. These desiderata are not an exhaustive enumeration but a starting point for discussions about what deserves and what requires protection by an international instrument. © 2023 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Translating legal neuroscience with artificial intelligence: only in this way will there be a low per-centage of wrongful convictions. For some time now, especially in common law jurisdictions, nanotechnology has not been such a remote idea for intervening in the brain activity of criminals. It is a valid reversible tool selective, precise and effective than psychopharmacological treatments. The technology, on which the neuro-devices are based, provides a pulse that alerts the subject with such implanted tools,without inhibiting him from his free will and conscious control. The function is thus twofold: predictive and preventive-rehabili-tative. The debated question is whether neurointervention should be only voluntary or also mandatory. Is neurointervention an essential component of sentencing or only one of its possible forms? An attempt will be made here to provide an opinion on how the use of nanotechnology applied to neurolaw is legitimate to the principles of substantive and procedural criminal law. © 2023, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Institute of State and Law.

    "Abstract": "While neuroscience has been used in Australian courts for the past 40 years, no systematic empirical study has been conducted into how neuroscientific evidence is used in courts. This study provides a systematic review on how neuroscientific evidence is considered in sentencing decisions of New South Wales criminal courts. A comprehensive and systematic search was conducted on three databases. From this search, 331 relevant sentencing decisions before 2016 that discussed neuroscientific evidence were examined. The findings of this study suggest that neuroscientific evidence appeared to contribute to sentencing decisions in less than half of the cases examined; and in the majority of these, it supported a more lenient sentence.

    "Abstract": "A new term, socially aligned networks, going beyond pure social media is introduced which considers the alignment of participants' common interests and ways how users communicate, create, compete, and/or challenge each other within technological ecosystems such as online services, gaming suites, metaverse or virtual/augmented-/extended-reality spaces. The current scope and predicted growth of the world digital population is considered in light of Big Tech companies' domination of social media as well as continuing digital exclusion. The ethical studies’ landscape is mapped by looking at comparative studies in this relatively new field and with the aim of establishing a suitable ethic principles baseline for such socially aligned networks further illustrated by human–AI interface case studies. Beyond establishing a suitable ethic principles baseline for such socially aligned networks, current advances in neuroethics are considered within the context of emotional AI and human–AI interactions. Neuroethics principles are considered within the context of different philosophical schools, leading to a discussion of relatively new neurorights. An interconnection of morality, ethics, and spirituality is discussed, together with immature legal frameworks and ethical boundaries for Internet of things (IoT) devices. In conclusion, neuroethics are considered a suitable blueprint for socially aligned networks and highlighting that regulation alone is likely not going to be sufficient on its own, particularly when considering the rapid growth of generative AI. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

    "Abstract": "This article will briefly discuss the concept of neuro-rights. These have been outlined, conceptualized, endowed with content or recognized in Spain, the European Union and elsewhere. Let us clarify, however, that we are basically talking about rights that are being discussed and for which protection is being requested, but actions in this sense are more or less recent, both from the legal perspective, as well as from the ethical and neuroscientific perspectives. In this regard, it should be noted that there are developments of a rather normative type and others of a more declarative type (or soft law), which we will discuss later and whose difference will be explained in due course. The introductory elements and background on neuro-rights will be discussed, given the increasingly notable approach to a new dimension not only of fundamental rights, but also of digital rights, among which are rights in the use of neurotechnologies and rights in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), addressed by the Spanish Charter of Digital Rights (section 5, articles XXI to XXVI). © IBERAMIA and the authors.",

    "Abstract": "This paper analyses recent calls for so called “neurorights”, suggested novel human rights whose adoption is allegedly required because of advances in neuroscience, exemplified by a proposal of the Neurorights Initiative. Advances in neuroscience and technology are indeed impressive and pose a range of challenges for the law, and some novel applications give grounds for human rights concerns. But whether addressing these concerns requires adopting novel human rights, and whether the proposed neurorights are suitable candidates, are a different matter. This paper argues that the proposed rights, as individuals and a class, should not be adopted and lobbying on their behalf should stop. The proposal tends to promote rights inflationism, is tainted by neuroexceptionalism and neuroessentialism, and lacks grounding in relevant scholarship. None of the proposed individual rights passes quality criteria debated in the field. While understandable from a moral perspective, the proposal is fundamentally flawed from a legal perspective. Rather than conjuring up novel human rights, existing rights should be further developed in face of changing societal circumstances and technological possibilities. © 2022, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The essay investigates the combination of artificial intelligence and cognitive enhancement technologies, a synergy that amplifies opportunities but also risks, mainly for the health and mental privacy of those willing to undergo the innovative practices it enables. With regard to health protection, the reflections carried out lead to the conclusion that it must constitute the limit to the individual’s request for neuroenhancement, if the requested treatment is even only potentially harmful. Regarding mental privacy, on the other hand, there is a pre-eminent need for sophisticated and constant monitoring, both by companies producing neurodevices and by the police, as well as for specific criminal legislation. In any case, protection must be constructed according to a multilevel scheme, first of all, resolving, at each regulatory level, the question of whether or not the existing provisions should be reformulated in the face of unprecedented technological developments in the sector. © 2022, Societa Editoriale Federalismi s.r.l..

    "Abstract": "Propaganda and manipulation have long been employed to influence and shape individuals' thoughts and identities. In the advent of the digital era, these techniques have become more sophisticated and invasive, and are utilized to further various causes. This article investigates the extent to which international human rights law affords protection against manipulation techniques such as microtargeting and behavioral reading, which can negatively impact individuals' mental health and autonomy by threatening their right to construct their own identity. The right to freedom of thought in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 18), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 18), and the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 9) offers absolute protection to individuals' inner selves and covers the protection against manipulation on paper. However, in practice, the right has not received much attention and has not reached its full potential due to its abstract and ambiguous nature. This Article analyzes the preparatory works of these human rights law instruments, with a particular focus on the right to freedom of thought, to clarify its origins and the intention behind its creation. The Article contends that the historical origins of the right do not provide sufficient answers to the current issue and contribute to the ineffective application of the right against emerging manipulative practices. The Article also proposes potential ways to clarify and strengthen the legal framework related to the right to freedom of thought. © 2023 Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Advances in neuroimaging and brain-machine interfacing (BMI) increasingly enable the large-scale collection and further processing of neural data as well as the modulation of neural processes. In parallel, progresses in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in machine learning, create new possibilities for decoding and analysing neural data for various purposes including health monitoring, screening for disease, cognitive enhancement, and device control. This contribution discusses some major ethical, technical, and regulatory issues associated with neural data analytics and delineates a roadmap for responsible innovation in this sector. Moreover, this paper review a variety of themes including mind reading, mental privacy, cybersecurity in commercial BMI, and issues of neurotechnology governance. Finally, a framework for responsible innovation and governance is presented. © 2023, UNIV CARLOSIII MADRID. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "This paper offers an overview of the technological possibilities and ethics of using AI to achieve human enhancement and more broadly what we call intellectual augmentation (IA). After explaining the central notions of human enhancement, IA, and AI, we discuss the main and most recent technologies for IA, with or without brain-computer interfaces. Given this picture, this paper discusses potential ethical problems, namely inadequate performance, safety, coercion and manipulation, privacy, cognitive liberty, authenticity, and fairness, in more detail. This paper concludes that while there are very significant technical hurdles to real human enhancement through AI, and significant ethical problems, there are also significant benefits that may realistically be achieved in ways that are consonant with a rights-based ethics as well. This paper also highlights the specific concerns that apply particularly to applications of AI for “sheer” IA (more realistic in the near term) and to enhancement applications, respectively. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Fabrice Jotterand and Marcello Ienca; individual chapters, the contributors.",

    "Abstract": "Neurodevices that collect neural (or brain activity) data have been characterised as having the ability to register the inner workings of human mentality. There are concerns that the proliferation of such devices in the consumer-directed realm may result in the mass processing and commercialisation of neural data (as has been the case with social media data) and even threaten the mental privacy of individuals. To prevent this, some argue that all raw neural data should be conceptualised and regulated as “medical data” even if it is collected from consumer-directed devices in obviously non-clinical settings. In this paper, we argue that without a clearer formulation of what does and does not count as medical data, this approach might also uncritically enlarge the scope for medical influence and an unwarranted medicalisation of everyday aspects of mental life. Indeed, if we were to accept the position that all neural data is medical data because it offers insights into personally sensitive information (such a person’s thoughts, emotions, or intentions) then this could even unnecessarily expand the boundaries of medical data to other forms of data that otherwise seem to be non-clinical. If all brain data (neural activity data) is considered to be medical data even when collected from consumer-directed devices then we might unintentionally reduce meaningful distinctions between what is and what is not rightfully in the purview of medicine. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

This paper analyses how core human rights pertain to neurotechnologies and might be interpreted in this context.

    "Abstract": "Previously confined to the distinct medical market, neurotechnologies are expanding rapidly into the consumer market, driven by technological advancements and substantial investments. While offering promising benefits, concerns have emerged regarding the suitability of existing legal frameworks to adequately address the risks they present. Against the background of an ongoing global debate on new policies or new ‘neurorights’ regulating neurotechnology, this paper delves into the regulation of consumer Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) in the European Union (EU), focusing on the pertinent product safety legislation. The analysis will primarily examine the sector-specific product safety law for medical devices, the Medical Devices Regulation (MDR). It will meticulously delineate which consumer BCIs fall within its scope and are obliged to comply with the requirements outlined. The tech-based approach of Annex XVI MDR, coupled with recent amendments, show that the EU has adopted a forward-thinking rationale towards regulating health-related risks associated with consumer BCIs within existing EU medical devices legislation, while abstaining from over-regulating aspects therein that are beyond its core objectives. Supplementary, the paper will discuss developments in EU horizontal product safety law, regulating all consumer BCIs that are not subject to sector-specific product safety legislation. In their recently adopted General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR), the EU has introduced several provisions addressing digital products. Inter alia, these changes will enhance the horizontal regulation of consumer BCIs. Overall, within the context of product safety law, the recent adaptations affirm notable efforts by the EU to refine the legal framework that governs consumer BCIs, striking a delicate balance between effective technology regulation and not impeding innovation. © 2024 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "Neurotechnologies broadly understood are tools that have the capability to read, record and modify our mental activity by acting on its brain correlates. The emergence of increasingly powerful and sophisticated techniques has given rise to the proposal to introduce new rights specifically directed to protect mental privacy, freedom of thought, and mental integrity. These rights, also proposed as basic human rights, are conceived in direct relation to tools that threaten mental privacy, freedom of thought, mental integrity, and personal identity. In this paper, our goal is to give a philosophical foundation to a specific right that we will call right to mental integrity. It encapsulates both the classical concepts of privacy and non-interference in our mind/brain. Such a philosophical foundation refers to certain features of the mind that hitherto could not be reached directly from the outside: intentionality, first-person perspective, personal autonomy in moral choices and in the construction of one's narrative, and relational identity. A variety of neurotechnologies or other tools, including artificial intelligence, alone or in combination can, by their very availability, threaten our mental integrity. Therefore, it is necessary to posit a specific right and provide it with a theoretical foundation and justification. It will be up to a subsequent treatment to define the moral and legal boundaries of such a right and its application. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This research aims to conceptualize cognitive liberty and the psychedelic humanities by examining their constitutive elements. The importance of this study lies in the fact that it is widespread to talk about psychedelic science nowadays, but there is a significant gap in the research. For instance, the role and importance of the humanities need to be acknowledged. Regarding cognitive liberty, this research considers that people have the right to use or refrain from using emerging neurotechnologies and psychedelics. People’s freedom of choice vis-à-vis these technologies must be protected, in particular with regard to coercive and non-consensual uses. Firstly, an analysis will be carried out of the constitutive elements of cognitive liberty, especially within the context of a philosophical approach. Secondly, this research will address some arguments for the philosophical uses of psychedelics. Finally, this paper will discuss the scope and significance of psychedelic humanities as a vein of research. Cognitive liberty is a crucial concept for the psychedelic humanities, likely to broaden our understanding of consciousness studies and reflect on ethical and social issues related to scientific research. Cognitive liberty is an update of freedom of thought according to the challenges of the 21st century. In addition, this paper will highlight the possible philosophical uses of psychedelic substances to broaden the research scope since, at present, the ritual and therapeutic uses of psychedelics have the most significant legitimacy. Recognition of philosophical uses demonstrates that learning from non-clinical uses of psychedelics is possible. The psychedelic humanities represent an underexplored avenue of research that can contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between science and culture.

    "Abstract": "Agents often exert influence when interacting with humans and non-human agents. However, the ethical status of such influence is often unclear. In this paper, we present the SHAPE framework, which lists reasons why influence may be unethical. We draw on literature from descriptive and moral philosophy and connect it to machine learning to help guide ethical considerations when developing algorithms with potential influence. Lastly, we explore mechanisms for governing influential algorithmic systems, inspired by regulation in journalism, human subject research, and advertising. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

    "Abstract": "This chapter canvasses the current relevance of behavioral neuroscience to the law, especially to issues of criminal responsibility and competence. It begins with an explanation of the legal doctrines at stake. I then explore the source of the often-inflated claims for the legal relevance of neuroscience. The next section discusses the scientific status of behavioral neuroscience. Then, it addresses two radical challenges to current conceptions of criminal responsibility that neuroscience allegedly poses: determinism and the death of agency. The question of the specific relevance of neuroscience to criminal law doctrine, practice, and institutions is considered next. This is followed by a discussion of how neuroscience evidence is being used in criminal cases in five different countries, including the United States. The penultimate section points to some areas warranting modest optimism. A brief conclusion suggests that neuroscience is at present of limited legal relevance, and advances in the science might alter that judgment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The protection of the mind through human rights law has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. Concerned by rapid developments in neurotechnology, some scholars have suggested the introduction of so-called ‘neurorights’: that is, human rights that specifically aim to protect people's minds against unwanted intrusion by neurotechnology. However, a cautious approach is advisable. Before robust claims about the need for neurorights can be made, it first needs to be examined what protection is currently offered within the existing human rights framework. Adequate safeguards to counter existing and upcoming threats to people's minds may already be available through an analysis of the current spectrum of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In this article, the role that the existing human rights framework could play in protecting people's minds will be examined. To that aim, first the need to protect people's mental sphere will be discussed. Subsequently, the existing human rights and fundamental freedoms will be assessed on their merits in providing adequate protection. © The Author(s) 2023.",

    "Abstract": "As neuroscience technologies develop, ethical and legal questions arise regarding their use and societal impact. Neuroethics and neurolaw are growing interdisciplinary fields that address these questions. This review article presents the research agenda of both areas, examines the use and admissibility of neuroscience in expert testimony and legal settings, and discusses ethical issues related to forensic neuropsychiatrists claiming expertise in neuroscience, formulating medical opinions based on neuroscience, and considering its relevance to criminal responsibility. Forensic neuropsychiatrists should be aware of emerging neuroscientific evidence, its utility and limits in rendering diagnoses and explaining behavior, and, before seeking such evidence for legal purposes, its availability and admissibility. When testifying in matters involving neuroscientific evidence, ensuring truthfulness and balance, having sufficient and validated knowledge (including openness with confirming and disconfirming evidence), understanding standards of practice, and drawing relevant and appropriate conclusions remain important. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "It has been argued that neural data (ND) are an especially sensitive kind of personal information that could be used to undermine the control we should have over access to our mental states (i.e. our mental privacy), and therefore need a stronger legal protection than other kinds of personal data. The Morningside Group, a global consortium of interdisciplinary experts advocating for the ethical use of neurotechnology, suggests achieving this by treating legally ND as a body organ (i.e. protecting them through bodily integrity). Although the proposal is currently shaping ND-related policies (most notably, a Neuroprotection Bill of Law being discussed by the Chilean Senate), it is not clear what its conceptual and legal basis is. Treating legally something as something else requires some kind of analogical reasoning, which is not provided by the authors of the proposal. In this paper, I will try to fill this gap by addressing ontological issues related to neurocognitive processes. The substantial differences between ND and body organs or organic tissue cast doubt on the idea that the former should be covered by bodily integrity. Crucially, ND are not constituted by organic material. Nevertheless, I argue that the ND of a subject s are analogous to neurocognitive properties of her brain. I claim that (i) s’ ND are a ‘medium independent’ property that can be characterized as natural semantic personal information about her brain and that (ii) s’ brain not only instantiates this property but also has an exclusive ontological relationship with it: This information constitutes a domain that is unique to her neurocognitive architecture. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Today, it is an inescapable reality that advances in neurotechnology have experienced a significant advance, bringing to the fore the uncertainty surrounding the possibility of scrutinizing and even controlling the human brain, and along with it our emotions or thoughts. This reality has given rise to currents within the Law, which advocate the systematization and regulation of a set of rights associated with the protection and defense of a kind of indemnity or inviolability of “the mental”. Even granting the category of fundamental human right to this series of so-called neuro-rights. The essay that follows aims to answer the question about what philosophical commitment exists behind a proposal for neurorights legislation. In order to elucidate such essential issues as the possibility of certainty about the existence of other minds, as a basic presupposition to formulate any type of regulation. © 2022 Universidad Nacional Experimental Rafael Maria Baralt.

    "Abstract": "Neurointerventions—interventions that cause direct physical, chemical or biological effects on the brain—are sometimes administered to criminal offenders for the purpose of reducing their recidivism risk and promoting their rehabilitation more generally. Ethical debate on this practice (henceforth called ‘neurocorrection’) has focused on the issue of consent, with some authors defending a consent requirement in neurocorrection and others rejecting this. In this paper, I align with the view that consent might not always be necessary for permissible neurocorrective use, but introduce a qualification I argue ought to inform our ethical and legal analysis of neurocorrection if we are to administer neurocorrectives nonconsensually. I maintain our use of nonconsensual neurocorrection should be constrained by a beneficence requirement—that it should be limited to neurocorrectives that can be expected to benefit those required to undergo them; and my argument is that a beneficence requirement is necessary in order to safeguard against offender abuse. I highlight how we afford a heightened protective role to beneficence in other instances of biomedical intervention where consent is absent or in doubt; and I argue a beneficence requirement is also necessary in the correctional context because alternative candidate protections would provide insufficiently strong safeguards on their own. I then consider whether requiring beneficence in nonconsensual neurocorrection would (a) be incompatible with penal theory, (b) be objectionably paternalistic, or (c) foreclose many fruitful avenues of crime control. I argue in each case that it would not. © 2022 The Authors. Bioethics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "The use of neurotechnologies for surveillance in the workplace have the potential to impact the entire working population of the world. Currently, with the help of neurodevices, employers could analyze the brain data from employees to assess their cognitive functions (such as mental capacity and efficiency), cognitive patterns (such as response to stress), and even detect neuropathologies. The workers brain data obtained with wearable neurodevices could serve employers for purposes such as promotion, hiring, or dismissal. Neurodevices could also be used as new micromanagement tools, aimed at monitoring employees' attention at work. Additionally, they can be implemented as tools for self-control for workers, as the feedback provided about their current cognitive state can help improve the outcomes of ongoing tasks and ensure safety. Recent studies have shown that while employees may recognize the potential benefits of using such technology for self-monitoring purposes, they have a negative perception toward its implementation in the workplace. Surprisingly, only a few scientific papers specifically address the issues of neurosurveillance in the workplace, while international frameworks have not yet provided precise responses to these new intrusive methods of monitoring workers. The overall goal of this paper is to discuss whether employers should be allowed to use neurosurveillance technologies in the workplace to monitor their employees' minds and, if so, under what circumstances. The authors take a hypothetical scenario of neurosurveillance in the workplace using EEG-based devices as a starting point for their analysis. On this basis, three key ethical issues are identified: an increasing power imbalance in the employment relationship; a new threat to employees' privacy, and a risk of neurodiscrimination.

    "Abstract": "The so-called neurorights are emerging human rights, or rather reconfigurations of already existing human rights, seeking to address the impact of the possible misuse of neurotechnologies, which have the potential to become more invasive and harmful in the future if not regulated. The aim of specifying neurorights is to protect the dignity and autonomy of the individual in the face of neurotechnological advances. Recently, Chile proposed a Constitutional reform inspired by the neurorights, opening a debate. One of the proposed neurorights is fair and equitable access to cognitive enhancement, which will be the specific object of this perspective article. Starting from the legal proposal, we analyse and discuss some perspectives on cognitive enhancement, or “neuroenhancement”, which could be considered as part of enhancement neurotechnologies, pointing out that pharmacological enhancers, or “smart drugs”, might be considered as part of these enhancers. We present a classification of the different types of cognitive enhancements as it has been proposed in the literature, into which pharmacological cognitive enhancement can be included, concluding that there is currently no agreement amongst scholars and lawyers about the ethical consideration of pharmacological cognitive enhancement. We therefore argue that it is necessary for the legislator to explicitly address the issue in the proposed regulations, in order to take a clear position on the topic, as it has been done in the United Kingdom, where the pharmacological neuroenhancers have been explicitly excluded from the regulation. If pharmacological neuroenhancers are going to be considered neurotechnologies, then new law proposals should seek harmonization with the already existing legislation regulating pharmacological health and consumer rights (both globally, taking into account international drug laws, and locally, according to each country's internal regulations) and of course, with the whole system of fundamental rights. Finally, we briefly discuss the ethical problem of equitable access to this new type of neurotechnologies (as part of the neurorights) and leave the debate open for new insights from the scientific community on the possible consequences of including (or not) pharmacological neuroenhancers as neurotechnologies for cognitive enhancement in the framework of the ethical and legal debate.

    "Abstract": "Individual autonomy has been explicitly recognized in the European Union’s 2022 Data Act proposal. This article shows that such unprecedented inclusion of autonomy in an EU regulatory framework targeting the digital domain marks a paradigm shift for digital-sector legislation away from mostly tacit recognition of autonomy as a meta-principle to a more ag-gressive regulatory posture. It contextualizes this nascent development by highlighting the turn towards the protection of mental privacy in recent sector-relevant legislation and in-vestigates the intent and scope of Article 6 of the Data Act proposal in light of an increas-ing regulatory focus on so-called dark patterns. © 2022, Lexxion Verlagsgesellschaft mbH.

    "Abstract": "In recent years, there has been significant research and debate about whether individuals can - and should be able to - improve their memory or other aspects of their cognition with cognitive enhancement drugs. This debate has largely been about ethics, but a debate has also emerged in legal scholarship about whether, if constitutional systems give individuals the freedom to shape their thinking in other ways (with books, conversations, software, or games), it should also give them freedom to safely do so with cognitive enhancement drugs. In the American context (which is the focus of this chapter), certain scholars argue that individuals’ long-recognized right to “freedom of thought, \" under the First Amendment of the US Constitution, should, in the twenty-first century, be understood as a broad right to “cognitive liberty, \" allowing us to shape our own minds medically as well as culturally. This chapter provides an overview of this argument and then examines two major reasons why American courts might resist it. One concerns the risks and uncertainties about the safety of pharmacological cognitive enhancement. Individuals have constitutional freedom to take action that comes with at least some risks to safety: Many forms of protest can involve physical action government has cause to regulate. So it is not safety risks by themselves that weigh against finding constitutional rights. It is rather because courts may well find, in analyzing laws about cognition enhancement drugs, that it is harder to disentangle safety issues (that government does have grounds to regulate) from liberty interests (that government does not). A second reason courts may continue to treat different forms of cognition enhancement differently is that historical tradition does so - and traditional differences may, in rights jurisprudence, often override functional similarities. The chapter ends by considering how, even when individuals lack constitutional rights to use pharmacological means of cognitive enhancement, legislatures can give them “quasi-constitutional” rights to do so. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",

    "Abstract": "The potential to collect brain data more directly, with higher resolution, and in greater amounts has heightened worries about mental and brain privacy. In order to manage the risks to individuals posed by these privacy challenges, some have suggested codifying new privacy rights, including a right to “mental privacy.” In this paper, we consider these arguments and conclude that while neurotechnologies do raise significant privacy concerns, such concerns are—at least for now—no different from those raised by other well-understood data collection technologies, such as gene sequencing tools and online surveillance. To better understand the privacy stakes of brain data, we suggest the use of a conceptual framework from information ethics, Helen Nissenbaum’s “contextual integrity” theory. To illustrate the importance of context, we examine neurotechnologies and the information flows they produce in three familiar contexts—healthcare and medical research, criminal justice, and consumer marketing. We argue that by emphasizing what is distinct about brain privacy issues, rather than what they share with other data privacy concerns, risks weakening broader efforts to enact more robust privacy law and policy. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Recent developments in the field of neuroimaging in the world of neuroscience, when combined with artificial intelligence and, more specifically, with the use of mechanical engineering, have resulted in the creation of brain reading technology that may soon be widely used in scientific fields in the world including detecting, for example, criminal lies. When used in forensic psychiatry, this approach can increase the precision of risk assessment and help determine areas where intervention can be most effective. Neuro prediction with artificial intelligence can be called AI. This neuroprotection is a method of predicting criminal behaviour by finding biomarkers of brain function that can indicate that someone is committing crimes in the future. Normative legal research or library legal research (library research), with a statute, conceptual, comparative, historical, or futuristic approach. The nature of the research used in this research is descriptive-prescriptive and uses content analysis. The result of this research is to dissect the development of AI Neuroprediction in forensic psychiatry and criminal justice with attention to this technology's legal and ethical implications and potential applications. In the future, AI neuroprediction may play an important role in integrating forensic psychology into the criminal justice system. Through in-depth analysis of neurological data, AI neuroprediction could assist in identifying behavioral patterns or tendencies that might influence a person's criminal propensity, thus enriching traditional forensic psychological evaluations. It may also contribute to creating more precise and personalized intervention strategies to prevent repeat crimes. © 2023 Zico Junius Fernando, Rosmanila, Laily Ratna, Achmad Cholidin and Bhanu Prakash Nunna.",

    "Abstract": "Neurotechnologies can pose a threat to people’s privacy and mental integrity. Hence the proposal of establishing neurorights (Ienca and Andorno, 2017) and technical principles for the implementation of these rights (Lavazza, 2018). However, concepts such as “the extended mind” and what might be called “the post-human objection” can be said to challenge this protection paradigm. On the one hand, it may be difficult to outline the cognitive boundaries between humans and machines (with the consequent ethical and legal implications). On the other hand, those who wish to make strong use of neurotechnologies, or even hybridize with them, reject the idea that privacy and mental integrity should be protected. However, from the latter view, issues may arise relating to the protection of persons entering into relationships with posthumanist people. This article will discuss these scenarios as well as the ethical, legal, social, and political issues that could follow from them. © Copyright © 2021 Inglese and Lavazza.",

    "Abstract": "Aim of the Study: The study examines how neurobiological and genetic explanations of psychopathy influence decision-making of German law students about legal and moral responsibility and sentencing of a defendant in a case of manslaughter. Previous studies from the United States and Germany have been criticized because they partly contradict legal analyses of real-world criminal cases. With a modified design, which integrates the main criticism, we re-examined the impact of biological explanations for psychopathy on decision-making in the courtroom. Methods: We developed an improved quasi-experimental design to probe three case vignettes presenting different explanations of psychopathy in a criminal case of manslaughter. All three vignettes present the same information about a forensic expert’s testimony that is said to report compelling evidence for the diagnosis of “psychopathy.” The independent variable being manipulated is the type of information supporting the expert diagnosis: either no biological explanation of “psychopathy” versus a neurological explanation (brain injury) versus a genetic explanation (MAOA gene). The outcome measure is a questionnaire on legal and moral responsibility, free will, the type of custody, and the duration of the sentence. The study is adequately powered. We openly publish the data and all statistical analyses as reproducible R scripts. Results: The answers of German law students (n = 317) indicate that the omission of a neurobiological explanation is significantly associated with higher ratings of legal responsibility while compared to no biological explanation. However, there was no significant difference on the prison sentencing and type of custody assigned. Furthermore, there was no difference in the self-reported impact of the explanation of psychopathy on the participants’ decision-making. Conclusion: Our findings from German law students corroborates previous research on German judges but is markedly distinct from studies on United States judges. Whereas in the United States, biological information seems to have a mitigating effect, it seems to increase the rate of involuntary commitment to forensic psychiatric hospitals in Germany. © Copyright © 2019 Guillen Gonzalez, Bittlinger, Erk and Müller.",

    "Abstract": "It is said that France entered a new “neurolaw” era, with the adoption of the July 7, 2011 bill which added to the civil code the first statement dedicated to judicial use of brain imaging. Some fear that such evidence may exert a “fascination effect.” By analyzing civil cases, this study provides empirical data and offers a starting point. Employing mixed quantitative and qualitative approaches, the author reviewed rulings from the Courts of Appeal and the Court of Cassation from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2016 that mention MRI and brain scans. Results show an increase use of brain imaging in civil litigation, but also reveal that civil judges are usually cautious, gathering a range of evidence including brain imaging. © Lextenso.

    "Abstract": "Objective: Identify factors related to bias in forensic psychiatric assessments in criminal matters. Method: Based on the PRISMA guidelines, we searched the following keywords with Boolean operators: (criminal responsibility OR legal responsibility OR neurolaw OR insanity defense) AND (forensic psychiatry OR assessment OR evaluation OR bias OR decision-making OR capacity OR psychometric). The search included publications from January 1998 to December 2019 in the English language, published in PubMed, Web of Science, Taylor & Francis, and Scopus databases. Results: The final sample consisted of 30 articles separated into three groups: (1) legal elements and the wording of expert reports, (2) psychometric tools applied to criminal inquiries, and (3) expert forensic technique and inter-examiner agreement. Discussion: Multiple factors for biases were identified: difficulties in equivalence between legal and psychiatric terminologies, elements of countertransference between the expert and the examinee, absence of standardization of expert evaluations, low quality of expert reports, differences in the training of professionals involved in the evaluations, use of psychometric tools, number of professionals working on the same case, and the methodology adopted. Psychometric tools developed specifically for forensic psychiatric evaluations allowed the introduction of objective parameters in expert evaluations. Special attention was found in psychometric tools structured as vignettes that allowed the detailed evaluation of legal capacities, present in the legal texts. Psychometric tools in checklist format appeared to be more susceptible to interviewer biases. Conclusion: The control of inherent biases in forensic psychiatry assessments on criminal matters remains a current challenge, difficult to control in forensic practice. The identification, control and avoidance of them may improve the quality the forensic psychiatric expertise in criminal matters. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "This chapter will address the potential contributions of neuroscience to law, with special emphasis on criminal justice and criminal responsibility because these are the areas that have received the lion’s share of neurolaw attention. The discussion will clearly generalize to other applications, however. The neurosciences in question are the behavioral neurosciences, such as cognitive, affective and social neuroscience, because these are the types of neuroscience most relevant to law. There have been major advances in these fields since the beginning of the present century when non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain function became widely available for non-clinical research. The central question for this chapter is the relevance of neuroscience to law. The general conclusion is that it is scarcely useful at present but may become more relevant as the science progresses. Many readers of this chapter may not be lawyers, so the chapter begins with a brief explanation of the meaning of criminal responsibility that will be used throughout. It then speculates about the source of claims for the positive influence of neuroscience. The next section discusses the scientific status of behavioral neuroscience. Then it addresses two radical challenges to current conceptions of criminal responsibility that neuroscience allegedly poses: determinism and the death of agency. The question of the specific relevance of neuroscience to criminal law doctrine, practice and institutions is considered next. This is followed by a discussion of how neuroscience evidence is being used in criminal cases in five different countries, including the United States. The penultimate section points to some areas warranting modest optimism. A brief conclusion follows. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",

    "Abstract": "Prison is by its nature a deliberately impoverished environment, with few physical, mental and social activities. Various studies have shown negative effects of an impoverished environment on animal as well as human brain functions. A recent study in a Dutch remand prison showed that brain functions connected with self-regulation decline after 3 months of imprisonment. Reduced self-regulation appears to be a risk factor for recidivism. In this article, we examine the legal implications of these neuropsychological findings in a European context. Firstly, we analyse these results in the light of the principle of rehabilitation as interpreted in case law of the European Court of Human Rights. Secondly, we explore how the neuropsychological insights could be relevant in the context of the prohibition of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment (Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)). We argue that if the impoverished prison environment hampers rehabilitation, states are positively obliged to take appropriate measures to counter these effects. Ultimately, negative effects on brain functioning by impoverished prison environments could even raise an issue under Article 3 ECHR. Furthermore, we argue that neuropsychological insights have to be taken into account when establishing the threshold according to which the European Court on Human Rights judges prison conditions. We conclude that in the light of these considerations further research on the neuropsychological effects of the prison environment is required. © The Author(s) 2019.",

    "Abstract": "Advancements in novel neurotechnologies, such as brain computer interfaces (BCI) and neuromodulatory devices such as deep brain stimulators (DBS), will have profound implications for society and human rights. While these technologies are improving the diagnosis and treatment of mental and neurological diseases, they can also alter individual agency and estrange those using neurotechnologies from their sense of self, challenging basic notions of what it means to be human. As an international coalition of interdisciplinary scholars and practitioners, we examine these challenges and make recommendations to mitigate negative consequences that could arise from the unregulated development or application of novel neurotechnologies. We explore potential ethical challenges in four key areas: identity and agency, privacy, bias, and enhancement. To address them, we propose (1) democratic and inclusive summits to establish globally-coordinated ethical and societal guidelines for neurotechnology development and application, (2) new measures, including “Neurorights,” for data privacy, security, and consent to empower neurotechnology users’ control over their data, (3) new methods of identifying and preventing bias, and (4) the adoption of public guidelines for safe and equitable distribution of neurotechnological devices. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Substance addiction affects millions of individuals worldwide and yet there is no consensus regarding its conceptualisation. Recent neuroscientific developments fuel the view that addiction can be classified as a brain disease, whereas a different body of scholars disagrees by claiming that addictive behaviour is a choice. These two models, the Brain Disease Model and the Choice Model, seem to oppose each other directly. This article contends the belief that the two models in the addiction debate are polar opposites. It shows that it is not the large amount of addiction research in itself what sets the models apart, but rather their extrapolated conclusions. Moreover, some of the most fiercely debated aspects - for instance, whether or not addiction should be classified as a disease or disorder - are irrelevant for the conceptualisation of addiction. Instead, the real disagreement is shown to revolve around capacities. Discussing addiction-related capacities, especially regarding impaired control, rather than the assumed juxtaposition of the two models can be considered the true addiction debate. More insight into the extent to which the capacities of the addicted individual were affected would be highly useful in various other areas, especially legal responsibility. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we focus on, a significant Australian sentencing appeal in which, after hearing expert evidence pertaining to cognitive function, brain scans, and neuropsychological testing, the Court imposed a less severe sentence than that originally imposed. Our aim is to produce an interdisciplinary critical analysis of the decision, and we approach this by analysing the judicial comments on the evidence pertaining to the offender's mental condition, and the reasoning about punishment. We conclude that the Court's inferences about frontal lobe damage and likely dementia are contestable, and the reasoning about mitigation of punishment based on these questionable inferences could have been improved by a focus on sentencing's retributive aim. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Various neuroscientific techniques are increasingly being used in criminal courts causing a vivid debate on the way that this kind of techniques will and should be used as scientific evidence. The role of experts in this context is important, since it is them that analyse, present, interpret and communicate the results of these techniques to the judges and the jury. In an attempt to contribute to the discussion about the role of the experts in criminal cases where neuroimaging evidence was introduced, we examined twenty seven cases from the US and Europe. Focusing on the role of experts and their presentation of neuroscientific evidence, we aimed to examine the extent to which neuroimaging data can contribute to the construction of a solid and more objective, “scientifically - based” case. We found that neurobiological information introduced through experts' testimony is generally used in order to demonstrate some physical, organic base of a psychiatric condition, or/and in order to make visible some brain lesion, (structural or functional), susceptible to have affected the capacity to reason and to control one's impulses. While neuroimaging evidence is often presented by the defence as a scientific method able to offer a precise diagnosis of the pathology in question, our case analysis shows that the very same neurobiological evidence can be interpreted in different - sometimes diametrically opposed - ways by defence and State experts. Conflicting testimony about the same empirical evidence goes against the hypothesis of neuroscientific techniques constituting “objective and hard evidence”, able to reach solid, scientific and objective conclusions. Frequent conflicts between neuroimaging experts require the courts to deal with the resulting uncertainty. As the law changes with technology, it is necessary for legal professionals to train and be prepared for the new issues they may encounter in light of new developments in neuroscience, so that they become more vigilant as to the interpretation of neuroscientific data. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "Previous publications discussed the conditions under which courts admitted or could admit neurotechnological evidence like brain scans. There were also first attempts to investigate legal decisions neuroscientifically. The present paper analyzes a different way in which neuroscience already influenced the law: The legal justification of the new Dutch adolescent criminal law explicitly mentions findings on brain development to justify a higher maximum age for the application of juvenile criminal law than before. The lawmaker’s reasoning is compared with the neuroscientific studies on which it is based. In particular, three neurodevelopmental publications quoted by the Dutch Council for the Administration of Criminal Justice and Protection of Juveniles to justify that adolescents can be legally less responsible are analyzed in detail. The paper also addresses possibilities under which brain research could improve legal decision-making in the future. One important aspect turns out to be that neuroscience should not only matter on the level of justification, but also provide better instruments on the individual level of application. © Copyright © 2020 Schleim.",

    "Abstract": "We seek to address current limitations of forensic risk assessments by introducing the first mobile, self-scoring, risk assessment software that relies on neurocognitive testing to predict reoffense. This assessment, run entirely on a tablet, measures decision-making via a suite of neurocognitive tests in less than 30 minutes. The software measures several cognitive and decision-making traits of the user, including impulsivity, empathy, aggression, and several other traits linked to reoffending. Our analysis measured whether this assessment successfully predicted recidivism by testing probationers in a large urban city (Houston, TX, United States) from 2017 to 2019. To determine predictive validity, we used machine learning to yield cross-validated receiver–operator characteristics. Results gave a recidivism prediction value of 0.70, making it comparable to commonly used risk assessments. This novel approach diverges from traditional self-reporting, interview-based, and criminal-records-based approaches, and can also add a protective layer against bias, while strengthening model accuracy in predicting reoffense. In addition, subjectivity is eliminated and time-consuming administrative efforts are reduced. With continued data collection, this approach opens the possibility of identifying different levels of recidivism risk, by crime type, for any age, or gender, and seeks to steer individuals appropriately toward rehabilitative programs. Suggestions for future research directions are provided. © Copyright © 2020 Haarsma, Davenport, White, Ormachea, Sheena and Eagleman.",

    "Abstract": "Recent research has detailed the use of neuroscience in several jurisdictions, but Australia remains a notable omission. To fill this substantial void we performed a systematic review of neuroscience in Australian criminal cases. The first section of this article reports the results of our review by detailing the purposes for which neuroscience is admitted into Australian criminal courts. We found that neuroscience is being admitted pre-trial (as evidence of fitness to stand trial), at trial (to support the defence of insanity and substantial impairment of the mind), and during sentencing. In the second section, we evaluate these applications. We generally found that courts admit neuroscience cautiously, and to supplement more well-established forms of evidence. Still, we found some instances in which the court seemed to misunderstand the neuroscience. These cases ranged from interpreting neuroscience as “objective” evidence to admitting neuroscience when the same non-neuroscientific psychiatric evidence would be inadmissible for being common sense. Furthermore, in some cases, neuroscientific evidence presents a double-edged sword; it may serve to either aggravate or mitigate a sentence. Thus, the decision about whether or not to tender this evidence is risky. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The reception of neurosciences on trial has had a history that extends to the 1940s, but it has intensified significantly in recent years in comparative jurisprudence, giving rise to the discipline of neurolaw. This work offers a synthesis of neurolaw in comparative jurisprudence and develops an analysis of the state of the arts in our national jurisprudence, by reviewing a jurisprudential database on the subject that runs between 2002 and 2019. It is concluded that neurolaw still has a very incipient development in our country and is concentrated mainly in issues of civil and labor damage litigation. © 2021 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

    "Abstract": "Human growth and development, starting from conception, are characterized by a progressive increase in body and organ dimensions, as well as specific functional maturity, under the influence of genetic as well as environmental and epigenetic determinants. Beyond a possible normal familial trait, increased fetal growth resulting in a large for gestational age newborn, isolated macrosomia or that associated with congenital malformation, can be attributable to both maternal metabolic and genetic pathology. Overgrowth syndromes are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by excessive tissue development often concomitant to neurodevelopmental involvement. Recently, an increased risk of fetal overgrowth with Assisted Reproductive Technology has been reported. Thus, in pediatric practice, it is fundamental to monitor any patient who presents with increased growth parameters, variable malformations, neurodevelopmental delay, and distinctive features from birth, aiming to ensure as adequate a medical management as possible, and for some of the disorders, strict tumor monitoring is also necessary. © EuroMediterranean Biomedical Journal 2020.",

    "Abstract": "The main objective of this paper is to shed light on the relationship between neurolaw and applied legal epistemology, as a new approach to the protection of human rights. An analytical study was carried to examine the relationship between neurolaw, at a prelegal and legal level. The neologism “forensic neuroepistemology” is proposed to denote the study of the role of neurosciences and neurotechnologies in the determination of truth in the law. Some cases from different countries are presented to show the real impact of neurotechnologies on judicial proceedings. The paper concludes with observations on the dilemmas that may arise between human rights by using neurotechnologies in the legal domain. © 2022 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

    "Abstract": "In recent years, philosophical-legal studies on neuroscience (mainly in the fields of neuroethics and neurolaw) have given increasing prominence to a normative analysis of the ethical-legal challenges in the mind and brain sciences in terms of rights, freedoms, entitlements and associated obligations. This way of analyzing the ethical and legal implications of neuroscience has come to be known as “neurorights.” Neurorights can be defined as the ethical, legal, social, or natural principles of freedom or entitlement related to a person’s cerebral and mental domain; that is, the fundamental normative rules for the protection and preservation of the human brain and mind. Although reflections on neurorights have received ample coverage in the mainstream media and have rapidly become a mainstream topic in the public neuroethics discourse, the frequency of such reflections in the academic literature is still relatively scarce. While the prominence of the neurorights debate in public opinion is crucial to ensure public engagement and democratic participation in deliberative processes on this issue, its relatively sporadic presence in the academic literature poses a risk of semantic-normative ambiguity and conceptual confusion. This risk is exacerbated by the presence of multiple and not always reconcilable terminologies. Several meta-ethical, normative ethical, and legal-philosophical questions need to be solved in order to ensure that neurorights can be used as effective instruments of global neurotechnology governance and be adequately imported into international human rights law. To overcome the shortcomings above, this paper attempts to provide a comprehensive normative-ethical, historical and conceptual analysis of neurorights. In particular, it attempts to (i) reconstruct a history of neurorights and locate these rights in the broader history of idea, (ii) outline a systematic conceptual taxonomy of neurorights, (iii) summarize ongoing policy initiatives related to neurorights, (iv) proactively address some unresolved ethico-legal challenges, and (v) identify priority areas for further academic reflection and policy work in this domain. © Copyright © 2021 Ienca.",

    "Abstract": "The increase in our interaction with robots and other artefacts highlights the ethical risks that this convergence in multi-agent systems produces, especially with regard to the privacy and integrity of brain data. As a result, new human neuro-rights are being proposed that call for mental integrity being preserved from unwanted interventions and for protection against the coercive use of technologies that may lead to psycho-physical harm, discrimination, and injustice. It seems prudent to establish basic and universal safeguards, in Human Rights terms, that establish a framework for these technologies and that can be incorporated into international and national fundamental rights legislation to establish guarantees for them. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

    "Abstract": "Modern neurotechnologies are rapidly infringing on conventional notions of human dignity and they are challenging what it means to be human. This article is a survey analysis of the future of the digital age, reflecting primarily on the effects of neurotechnology that violate universal human rights to dignity, self-determination, and privacy. In particular, this article focuses on neuromarketing to critically assess potentially negative social ramifications of under-regulated neurotechnological application. Possible solutions are critically evaluated, including the human rights claim to the 'right to mental privacy' and the suggestion of a new human right based on spiritual jurisdiction, where the human psyche is a legal space in a substantive legal setting. © 2019 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Different studies have shown that neuroimaging technologies can contribute to answering crucial legal questions of criminal law, generally regarding guilt, legal insanity and the risk of recidivism. However, the use of neuroimaging in criminal law also raises important legal questions. One of those questions is whether neuroimaging should be applied coercively to defendants and prisoners in light of privacy considerations. This paper examines this question regarding the European legal context. I argue that most neuroimaging applications yield data, which is, in terms of privacy sensitivity, no more sensitive than data acquired through current methods of criminal investigation, such as compulsory DNA testing. Therefore, I argue that some types of coercive neuroimaging will, in general and under certain specific conditions and safeguards, not contravene the right to privacy as set out in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. I suggest that while on the one hand one could advocate the need for a novel, specific European human right to mental privacy, on the other hand, it is possible to argue that such a right may be superfluous in respect of the use of existing neuroimaging technologies. © 2019 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "With the advent of Industry 4.0, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), smart entities are now able to read the minds of users via extracting cognitive patterns from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Such brain data may include users' experiences, emotions, motivations, and other previously private mental and psychological processes. Accordingly, users' cognitive privacy may be violated and the right to cognitive privacy should protect individuals against the unconsented intrusion by third parties into the brain data as well as against the unauthorized collection of those data. This has caused a growing concern among users and industry experts that laws to protect the right to cognitive liberty, right to mental privacy, right to mental integrity, and the right to psychological continuity. In this paper, we propose an AI-enabled EEG model, namely Cognitive Privacy, that aims to protect data and classifies users and their tasks from EEG data. We present a model that protects data from disclosure using normalized correlation analysis and classifies subjects (i.e., a multi-classification problem) and their tasks (i.e., eye open and eye close as a binary classification problem) using a long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning approach. The model has been evaluated using the EEG data set of PhysioNet BCI, and the results have revealed its high performance of classifying users and their tasks with achieving high data privacy.  © 2020 IEEE.",

    "Abstract": "Legal reasoning, from the decision of United Chambers of Supreme Court, through the legal assistance activity carried out by a lawyer, to the purchase of an object on Amazon by a common citizen (which integrates a contractual constraint), contains in itself assessments of opportunity and moral evaluation, problem solving, decision making and, in general, a cognitive activation very wide ranging. Thanks to the multidisciplinary vocation of neuroscience, in particular focused at the cognitive field in legal practice, the aim of the research in cognitive neuroscience applied to law is to help to bridge the lack of in-depth analysis in the decision-making processes that the main players of the law, such as judges and lawyers, are informed. And all this, taking into account the ethical issues that occur above all in the comparative analysis of neuroscience-law interaction. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Recently, the Chilean Senate approved the main ideas of a constitutional reform and a Neuro-rights bill. This bill aims to protect people from the potential abusive use of \"neuro-technologies\". Unfortunately, a literal interpretation of this law can produce severe negative effects both in the development of neuroscience research and medical practice in Chile, interfering with current treatments in countless patients suffering from neuropsychiatric diseases. This fear stems from the observation of the negative effects that recent Chilean legislations have produced, which share with the Neuro-Rights Law the attempt to protect vulnerable populations from potential abuse from certain medical interventions. In fact, Law 20,584 promulgated in 2012, instead of protecting the most vulnerable patients \"incapacitated to consent\", produced enormous, and even possibly irreversible, damage to research in Chile in pathologies that require urgent attention, such as many neuropsychiatric diseases. This article details the effects that Law 20.584 had on research in Chile, how it relates to the Neuro-Rights Law, and the potential negative effects that the latter could have on research and medical practice, if it is not formulated correcting its errors. © 2021 Sociedad Medica de Santiago.

    "Abstract": "When it becomes available, neuroscience-based apprehension of subjective thoughts is bound to have a profound impact on several areas of society. One of these areas is medicine. In principle, medical specialties that are primarily concerned with mind and brain are most likely to apply neurotechnological thought apprehension (NTA) techniques. Psychiatry is such a specialty, and the relevance of NTA developments for psychiatry has been recognized. In this article, I discuss ethical issues regarding the use of NTA techniques in psychiatric contexts. First, I consider the notion of neurotechnological “thought apprehension,” as well as some limitations of present-day NTA applications. Next, I identify ethical priorities for its possible future use in psychiatry. The topics I explore concern key (bio)ethical issues: confidentiality, trust and distrust, consent and coercion, and, finally, responsibility. I conclude that mental health-related use of NTA entails some specific ethical concerns that deserve careful attention before introducing these technologies in psychiatric practice. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, we are witnessing the increasing scholarly attention to neuroscience achievements in the context of the law. However, the complexity of the brain cognitive functions and the performance limits of current neuroscience techniques for discovering the secrets of the brain on one hand, and the need for neuro-litigation development with ethical-legal constraints, on the other hand, caused some limits in ‘law and neuroscience’. What credit can be given to neuroscience today in full development? Can functional brain imaging have a place in criminal procedures to assess liability and dangerousness, for example? We will consider the limits of the techniques as well as the possible progress of the legislation in this field. These questions justify the creation of a new interdisciplinary concept: Neurolaw or Law applied to neuroscience. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",

    "Abstract": "Despite several decades of growing interest in the concept of neurolaw in English-speaking countries, it is only a recent area of focus in Latin America. The objective of this article was to facilitate evidence-informed public policy by examining the current state of neurolaw in Latin America. To achieve this goal, this systematic review summarizes published articles, books, and book chapters, and discusses seminal legal cases in order to identify the current state of neurolaw in Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. In total, 61 publications were identified, with the majority coming from Mexico (n = 17), Argentina (n = 15), and Colombia (n = 12). None of the published work identified presented empirical research, but many publications discussed complex topics such as criminal responsibility, free will, and neuroethics. The scant literature base and high concentration of publications emanating from three countries suggest that despite its growing impact abroad, more work is needed in this area in order to influence Latin America legislation and on the development of public policies. Future areas of research and policy related implications are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 International Association of Forensic Mental Health Services.",

    "Abstract": "Neuroscience produces a wealth of data on the relationship between brain and behavior, including criminal behavior. The research field studying the possible and actual impact of neuroscience on the law and legal practices, is called neurolaw. It is a new and rapidly developing domain of interdisciplinary research. Since forensic psychiatry has to do with both neuroscience and the law, neurolaw is of specific relevance for this psychiatric specialty. In this contribution, I will discuss three main research areas in neurolaw – revision, assessment, and intervention – and explore their relevance for forensic psychiatry. I will identify some valuable possibilities as well as some notable challenges – both technical and ethical – for forensic psychiatry regarding neurolaw developments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

    "Abstract": "This article critically addresses the convenience of creating new human neurorights to address the use of neuroprediction and lie detection technologies in penal systems. On this point, it is argued that neurorights could be conceptually problematic, or offer less protection than the one that can be extended by better interpretations of current fundamental rights and the constitutional principles of criminal law. The article ends by formulating a new critical proposal to limit neurotechnolo gy and propose the abolition of criminal law; we have called this proposal “penal neuroabolitionism”. © 2022 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

    "Abstract": "5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (acronymized as 5-MeO-DMT) is sui generis among the numerous naturally occurring psychoactive substances due to its unparalleled ego-dissolving effects which can culminate in a state of nondual consciousness that is phenomenologically similar to transformative peak experiences described in various ancient contemplative traditions (e.g., Advaita Vedānta, Mahāyāna Buddhism, inter alia). The enigmatic molecule is endogenous to the human brain and has profound psychological effects which are hitherto only very poorly understood due to the absence of scientifically controlled human experimental trials. Its exact neuronal receptor binding profile is a matter of ongoing research; however, empirical evidence indicates that its remarkable psychoactivity is partially mediated via agonism of the 5-HT1A/2A (serotonin) receptor subtypes. Anthropological/ethnopharmacological evidence indicates that various cultures utilized 5-MeO-DMT containing plants for medicinal, psychological, and spiritual purposes for millennia. We propose that this naturally occurring serotonergic compound could be fruitfully utilized as a neurochemical research tool with the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the psychological and neuronal processes which underpin cognition and creativity (e.g., downregulation of the default mode network, increased global functional connectivity, neuroplasticity, σ1 receptor interactions, etc.). An eclectic interdisciplinary perspective is adopted, and we present converging evidence from a plurality of sources in support of our conjecture. Specifically, we argue that 5-MeO-DMT has significant neuropsychopharmacological potential due to its incommensurable capacity to completely disintegrate self-referential cognitive/neuronal processes (viz., ego death). The importance of unbiased systematic scientific research on naturally occurring endogenous psychoactive compounds is discussed from a Jamesian radical empiricism perspective, and potential scenarios of abuse are addressed, particularly in the context of neuroethics, cybernetic manipulation, and military research on torture. © 2019, Neuroscientia.",

    "Abstract": "Acquired psychopathy is often seen following acquired physical injury to frontal brain systems and with neurodegenerative diseases such as the frontotemporal dementias, strokes, and traumatic brain injury. Acquired psychopathy is a term of art in the neuropsychiatric literature and more recently is used in the neurolaw literature. The main anatomic neuro‐moral areas are the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and adjacent anatomic frontal connections. Neuroscience is presently well ahead of legal thinking in regard to legal decision‐making and responsibility. U.S. courts have been reluctant to tackle the volitional aspects of human behavior that have been modified by brain injury or cerebral disease. This chapter examines the neurobiology of moral decision‐making and more than 60 years of United States court decisions and legal scholarship relevant to neuro‐moral behavior. Legal approaches to acquired psychopathy are nascent promises currently not fulfilled. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "In this article, we analyze the contributions of neuroscience to the development of the adolescent brain and shed additional light on the minimum age of criminal responsibility in the context of Latin America. In neurobiology, maturity is perceived to be complex because the brain’s temporal development process is not uniform across all its regions. This has important consequences for adolescents’ behavior; in their search for the acceptance of their peers, they are more vulnerable to pressure and more sensitive to stress than adults. Their affectivity is more unstable, and they show signs of low tolerance to frustration and important emotional reactivity, with a decrease in the capacity to self-regulate. Consequently, risky behavior presents itself more frequently during adolescence, and behaviors that transgress norms and social conventions typically peak between the ages of 17 and 19 years. However, only a small percentage of young offenders escalate their behavior to committing crimes during adulthood. In comparative law, there are considerable differences in Latin American countries’ legal dispositions regarding the minimum age of criminal responsibility; Brazil, Costa Rica, and Ecuador regard the age of criminal responsibility to be 12 years, while Argentina accepts this to be 16 years. From a legal viewpoint, however, the debate about the minimum age of criminal responsibility is connected to other circumstances that, because they are still at a developmental stage, are attributed to adolescents’ rights in their decision-making and understanding of autonomy (e.g., the minimum ages for voting, alcohol consumption, and medical consent). We argue that research on the development of the adolescent brain does not provide definitive answers about the exact age required for different juridical purposes. Nonetheless, the current state of knowledge does allow for reflection on the development and maturation of adolescents and the implications for considering them criminally responsible. It also validates demands for a system that provides adolescents with greater protection and that favors their healthy integral development. In any case, although a specific minimum age is not evident, this study is disposed not to recommend lowering the age of criminal responsibility, but rather increasing it. © Copyright © 2020 Mercurio, García-López, Morales-Quintero, Llamas, Marinaro and Muñoz.",

    "Abstract": "Contemporary brain reading technologies promise to provide the possibility to decode and interpret mental states and processes. Brain reading could have numerous societally relevant implications. In particular, the private character of mind might be affected, generating ethical and legal concerns. This paper aims at equipping ethicists and policy makers with conceptual tools to support an evaluation of the potential applicability and the implications of current and near future brain reading technology. We start with clarifying the concepts of mind reading and brain reading, and the different kinds of mental states that could in principle be read. Subsequently, we devise an evaluative framework that is composed of five criteria-accuracy, reliability, informativity, concealability and enforceability-aimed at enabling a clearer estimation of the degree to which brain reading might be realistically deployed in contexts where mental privacy could be at stake. While accuracy and reliability capture how well a certain method can access mental content, informativity indicates the relevance the obtainable data have for practical purposes. Concealability and enforceability are particularly important for the evaluation of concerns about potential violations of mental privacy and civil rights. The former concerns the degree with which a brain reading method can be concealed from an individual’s perception or awareness. The latter regards the extent to which a method can be used against somebody’s will. With the help of these criteria, stakeholders can orient themselves in the rapidly developing field of brain reading. © 2017, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Since advances in brain-reading technology are changing traditional epistemic boundaries of the mind, yielding information from the brain that enables to draw inferences about particular mental states of individuals, the sustainability of the present framework of European human rights has been called into question. More specifically, it has been argued that in order to provide adequate human rights protection from non-consensual brain-reading, the right to freedom of thought should be revised, making it 'fit for the future' again. From the perspective of criminal justice, the present paper examines whether such a revision is necessary within the European legal context. It argues that under its current understanding, the right to freedom of thought would probably not cover the employment of most brain-reading applications in criminal justice. By contrast, the right to freedom of (non-)expression will provide legal protection in this regard and, at the same time, will also allow for certain exceptions. Hence, instead of revising the absolute right to freedom of thought, a legal approach tailored to non-consensual brain-reading could be developed under the already existing right not to convey information, ideas, and opinions as guaranteed under the freedom of (non-)expression. This might need to re-interpret the right to freedom of expression, rather than the right to freedom of thought.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.",

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, law is led to a widespread connection with neuroscience. Neurolaw as an interdisciplinary field of study has emerged in the postmodern era of law and neuroscience. However, it clearly has roots that directly trace back to several discourses have traditionally upheaved from the field of medico-legal approaches in the 19th century (the classic era), or the EEG and psychosurgery era in the 20th century (the modern era). This paper strives to put these three periods under scrutiny in order to display a relatively clear image of developed neurolaw background. In this paper it was found that the classic era was the platform for multidimensional medico-legal discourses to provide the ground for the brain evidence-based analysis of legal phenomena in the modern era and bring neurolaw into being as a consequence, which is increasingly encompassing litigations, legislations, and legal thoughts by employing the modern neuroscience findings. By scrutinizing these distinct historical periods, it became clear that medico-legal discourses took their path to the realm of neurolaw as a distinct field of study to transmogrify the practical and theoretical context of law by transition of the perspective from a pure legal to a specialized neurolaw approach. © 2019, STS Science Centre Ltd.

    "Abstract": "Culpability lies at the heart of our moral and legal practices of blaming, censuring, and punishing. Put simply, an agent is culpable for an action if the action is wrongful and the agent is responsible for that action. This seemingly straightforward concept remains contested within philosophy and legal theory, however, especially in the relatively new fields of neuroethics and neurolaw. How to understand responsible agency, which agents are potential bearers of culpability in general—and for which actions—and the possible evidentiary relevance of neuroscientific findings to these topics are all subjects of active debate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Abstract": "There have been extraordinary developments in the field of neuroscience in recent years, sparking a number of discussions within the legal field. This book studies the various interactions between neuroscience and the world of law, and explores how neuroscientific findings could affect some fundamental legal categories and how the law should be implemented in such cases. The book is divided into three main parts. Starting with a general overview of the convergence of neuroscience and law, the first part outlines the importance of their continuous interaction, the challenges that neuroscience poses for the concepts of free will and responsibility, and the peculiar characteristics of a “new” cognitive liberty. In turn, the second part addresses the phenomenon of cognitive and moral enhancement, as well as the uses of neurotechnology and their impacts on health, self-determination and the concept of being human. The third and last part investigates the use of neuroscientific findings in both criminal and civil cases, and seeks to determine whether they can provide valuable evidence and facilitate the assessment of personal responsibility, helping to resolve cases. The book is the result of an interdisciplinary dialogue involving jurists, philosophers, neuroscientists, forensic medicine specialists, and scholars in the humanities; further, it is intended for a broad readership interested in understanding the impacts of scientific and technological developments on people’s lives and on our social systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",

    "Abstract": "A central question in the current neurolegal and neuroethical literature is how brain-reading technologies could contribute to criminal justice. Some of these technologies have already been deployed within different criminal justice systems in Europe, including Slovenia, Italy, England and Wales, and the Netherlands, typically to determine guilt, legal responsibility, or recidivism risk. In this regard, the question arises whether brain-reading could permissibly be used against the person's will. To provide adequate legal protection from such non-consensual brain-reading in the European legal context, ethicists have called for the recognition of a novel fundamental legal right to mental privacy. In this paper, we explore whether these ethical calls for recognising a novel legal right to mental privacy are necessary in the European context. We argue that a right to mental privacy could be derived from, or at least developed within in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, and that introducing an additional fundamental right to protect against (forensic) brain-reading is not necessary. What is required, however, is a specification of the implications of existing rights for particular neurotechnologies and purposes. © 2020, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The paper discusses the contribution that the neuroscience of action can offer to the legal understanding of action control and responsibility in the case of adult individuals. In particular, we address the issues that follow. What are the cognitive capacities that agents must display in order to be held liable to punishment in criminal law? Is the legal model of liability to punishment compatible with a scientifically informed understanding of voluntary behaviour? To what extent should the law take into account people’s subjective feelings about their own actions? As a result of our analyses, we indicate some areas where the contribution of the neuroscience of action to the law is potentially relevant. We focus on the subjectivity mechanisms of action control, specifically the requirement that the agent must violate the law voluntarily in order to be held responsible, and on the factors that modulate the wrongdoer’s experience of agency. Overall, we advocate more cross-disciplinary work, aimed to bridge the gap between conceptual boundaries, on the theme of responsibility for actions. © 2019, Engg Journals Publications.

We think that neurorights derive from the interplay of values that constitute the SPJ's elements. The neurorights require general constitutional recognition and adequate systematisation. We describe the SPJ's elements that emerge from the characterization of each neuroright. We use categories provided by the legal strategy to analyse neurorights in the LCS. We offer hypotheses for the use of neurological technology, where the elements of the SPJ represented by the exercised neuroright and by the remaining parts of the SPJ compete, seeking a coherent solution. © 2022 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

    "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence and the internet of things, direct heirs of the earth-shattering fourth industrial revolution, are bound to be seismic shift in the purview of criminal procedure, which will be transmogrified beyond recognition. This paper aims, concretely, to pore over the difficult trade-off between artificial intelligence and the defendant's fundamental rights in the remit of criminal procedure law. Chiefly the defendant's right to mental privacy, which derives from nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare. This paper endeavours to flesh out the great bulk of these ground-breaking changes, which are shaping up to take place in the remit of criminal procedure law. © 2022 Instituto Brasileiro de Direito Processual Penal.

    "Abstract": "Even if under a lot of stress at the moment, human rights are generally considered to be absolutes that should not be touched nor put into question. Yet, re-cent biotechnological and neuroscientific discoveries have led many scholars to call for an increase in the level of alert that such changes in our society could imply - reaching the suggestion that we should implement new, additional human rights (cognitive liberty, mental privacy, mental integrity, psychological continuity) aimed at dealing with the specific threats that our mental privacy, autonomy and integrity could suffer from. Surely this scenario includes in direct ways our approach to in-formed consent and the objective of this paper is to highlight how six of the most prominent religious traditions and cultures in the world (Buddhism, Christianity, Con-fucianism, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism) can interact with these new human rights, underlining the specific role of informed consent within each tradition and in which way the possible implementation of this new way of conceptualizing human rights could impact -if at all- on any of the already established guidelines of each of them. © 2019 University of Trento.",

    "Abstract": "Of the many futuristic prospects offered by neuroscience, one of the more controversial is ‘brain reading’: the use of functional neuroimaging to gain information about subjects’ mental states or thoughts. This technology has various possible applications, including ‘neuromarketing’ and lie detection. Would such applications violate subjects’ privacy rights? Conversely, if God knows and judges all our secret thoughts, do Christians have any stake in defending a right to mental privacy? This article argues that God’s knowledge of us is different not only in degree but in kind from the knowledge sought through brain reading. This view of divine knowledge supports a theological account of privacy, richer and broader in scope than standard accounts of privacy rights, which can aid the ethical analysis of the use of brain reading technology for purposes such as marketing and lie detection. © The Author(s) 2020.",

    "Abstract": "The brain-technology frontier is enabled by neuroergonomists and allied professionals who have joined forces with neuroscientists, neuroengineers, signal and systems engineers to design, develop and deploy brain-in-the-loop automation or autonomous systems. We may refer to such systems as ‘brain systems.’ The neurodata that flow in such systems are unlike any other behavioral or physiological information since neurosignals acquired from the brain reveal the inner workings of our mind. This paper calls for a new age ‘neuroergonomics philosophy’ that informs rethinking of the ‘neuroergonomic code-of-conduct’ that unequivocally acknowledges our commitment to moral responsibilities, individual and social accountability while also certifying our competence in safeguarding neurodata, and by implication, neurorights. Proactive engagement in interdisciplinary professional and civil discourse and intercultural activities will pave the way to farsighted and strategic thinking in neuroergonomics. Partnerships with scholars and students of human nature as well as social, political and legal scientists in advocacy, in development of standards, policies and legal frameworks are encouraged. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

    "Abstract": "Brain-imaging technologies have posed the problem of breaching our brain privacy. Until the invention of those technologies, many of us entertained the idea that nothing can threaten our mental privacy, as long as we kept it, for each of us has private access to his or her own mind but no access to any other. Yet, philosophically, the issue of private, mental accessibility appears to be quite unsettled, as there are still many philosophers who reject the idea of private, mental accessibility. On panenmentalist grounds, I have attempted to refute such rejections and to establish this idea on firmer grounds. My arguments in this Chapter show that brain imaging allows no access to our mind and that psychical privacy is quite different from brain privacy, as the latter can be breached by brain imaging, whereas the former cannot. From a panenmentalist psychophysical view, a reduction of the mind to the body will inevitably fail, as there is a categorical difference between mind and body or brain, which is compatible with their inseparability. Brain imaging cannot enable one to “read” the mind or to breach our mental privacy, based upon the panenmentalist principle that a person’s mind is a singular individual pure possibility, which is wholly different from any other individual possibility, pure or actual. Hence, there is no external access to one’s mind. Each of us has exclusive access to his or her own mind, which is a singular individual pure possibility. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

    "Abstract": "This special issue is dedicated to the potential role of neuroscience in forensic psychiatry and psychology. Although neuroscientific insights are increasingly incorporated in clinical practice, they received less attention in forensic mental healthcare and in the forensic mental health literature. In the last decade there has been an increased interest in using neuroscientific knowledge in the assessment and treatment of psychopathology related to antisocial and violent behavior. Consequently, neuroscientific methods may, for example, be used in detecting psychiatric problems in defendants, one of the topics covered by the scientific field of neurolaw. This current article introduces this special issue by providing an introduction to the neurobiology of antisocial and criminal behavior and will set off discussing how neuroscientific insights may be used in forensic clinical practice. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "The purpose of the article is to consider comprehensively the phenomenon of the neurolaw, assessing it as a product of bioethics and behaviorism, a likely separate branch of law or the institution of medical law, as well as to analyze the feasibility of its introduction in the national justice system or refusal from it as a way of avoiding the responsibility of criminals. In general, the neurolaw is an interdisciplinary, intersectoral sphere of knowledge, formed on the basis of applying the results of researches in the field of medicine (in particular, neurology) in jurisprudence. This became possible, since human behavior (especially in the case of deviations from the norm) can sometimes be explained only with the help of anatomy, biochemistry and physiology of the nervous system. The authors consider that neurolaw is an institution of medical law, which regulates social relations in the field of medical intervention (examination and/or diagnosis of the nervous system or its individual components) for carrying out medical examinations and providing legal and medical qualifications. The neurolaw belongs to the new biomedical, legal and social phenomena in the structure of the so-called healthcare law, which, in its turn, combines the law of public health, medical and pharmaceutical law. Currently, the neurolaw as a theoretical construct and practical phenomenon is only at the stage of study and requires a detailed and thorough research so that its introduction into the legal system does not threaten non-compliance with the fundamental legal principles of equality and justice.",

    "Abstract": "Scholars from various disciplines discuss the ethical, legal, and social implications of neurotechnology. Some have proposed four concrete “neurorights”. This review presents the research of two pioneers in brain stimulation from the 1950s to 1970s, José M. R. Delgado and Elliot S. Valenstein, who also reflected upon the ethical, legal, and social aspects of their and other scientists’ related research. Delgado even formulated the vision “toward a psychocivilized society” where brain stimulation is used to control, in particular, citizens’ aggressive and violent behavior. Valenstein, by contrast, believed that the brain is not organized in such a way to allow the control or even removal of only negative processes without at the same time diminishing desirable ones. The paper also describes how animal and human experimentation on brain stimulation was carried out in that time period. It concludes with a contemporary perspective on the relevance of neurotechnology for neuroethics, neurolaw, and neurorights, including two recent examples for brain-computer interfaces.

    "Abstract": "This article explores the need to rethink the characteristics of law with respect to neurorights. Through an iusnaturalistic approach, it reflects on the emergence of the human right to self-knowledge in Mexico based on neurosciences. The argumentation of this work revolves around the unconscious of the human being. The limitations of the legal construction to protect the internal processes of the brain and its consideration as a relevant object to determine rights and obligations are analyzed. The neologism “intranomia” is proposed to distinguish the internal processes of the brain from the autonomy of the will. It is concluded that the respect, protection and guarantee of the human unconscious implies the deconstruction of the traditional schemes of law. © 2022 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

    "Abstract": "The growing influx of neuroscientific evidence in various criminal justice systems has prompted a number of excellent assessments of the nature and degree of its impact in courtrooms across the world. There have been few efforts, however, to conduct a comparative analysis of systematic empirical research on the use of neuroscientific evidence in criminal cases, which is this chapter's goal. This review examines seven systematic and empirical studies that are compared and contrasted across six different countries: England and Wales, Canada, the United States, Slovenia, and the Netherlands. The approach aims to break new ground by offering a thorough and updated analysis of all studies with consideration to the nuances of their respective methodologies, databases, and legal systems. As scientific advances are incorporated into legal settings on an increasingly frequent and sophisticated basis, this focus also considers how such research could be improved in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

    "Abstract": "Neurolaw is an interdisciplinary research program which aims not only to re-examine the axioms of law but also to enrich it in term of methodology and evidence. Although historically there are cases of application of neuroscience in the legal sphere, rapid growth has been recorded only after 1990. The radical debate in the field is between two perspectives i.e. neuroscience will show that we don’t have free will and this will lead to non-assignment of responsibility for actions including legal one and secondly, that neuroscience will show that humans have free will and thus there will be no changes in the legal system. In, this paper we will migrate from these theoretical arguments, to access the infield contribution of neuroscience to the legal system i.e. neurolaw. © 2020 IJSTR.",

    "Abstract": "Since the 1990's, neurolaw is on the rise. At the heart of heated debates lies the recurrent theme of a neuro-revolution of criminal responsibility. However, caution should be observed: the alleged foundations of criminal responsibility (amongst which free will) are often inaccurate and the relative imperviousness of its real foundations to scientific facts often underestimated. Neuroscientific findings may impact on social institutions, but only insofar as they also engage in a political justification of the changes being called for, convince populations, and take into consideration the ensuing consequences. Moreover, the many limits of neuroscientific tools call for increased vigilance when, if ever, using neuroscientific evidence in a courtroom. In this article, we aim at setting the basis for future sound debates on the contribution of neuroscience to criminal law, and in particular to the assessment of criminal responsibility. As such, we provide analytical tools to grasp the political and normative nature of criminal responsibility and review the current or projected use of neuroscience in the law, all the while bearing in mind the highly publicized question: can neuroscience revolutionize criminal responsibility? Answering this question implicitly requires answering a second question: should neuroscience revolutionize the institution of criminal responsibility? Answering both, in turn, requires drawing the line between science and normativity, revolution and dialogue, fantasies and legitimate hopes. © 2019 Bigenwald and Chambon.",

    "Abstract": "Current advances in neurotechnology promise to revolutionize a number of medical treatments. However, for some, these advances would increase social inequalities and would offer corporations, hackers, and governments the opportunity to exploit and manipulate human mind at will. For this reason, it has been suggested over the last years that any type of neurotechnology should be accompanied by a normative support aiming at protecting privacy, identity, agency, and equity of human beings. This legal support has been recently named as neurorights. In this article, we focus on we question about whether it is necessary to legislate about neurorights in this moment of the development of current research in biotechnology. The article does not consist of an analysis of the bill currently under development, but rather a reflection on the very idea of legislating in this area. © 2021 Universidad de Chile.

    "Abstract": "Multiple sexual violation causes alterations in the victim that result in sequelae of damage and suffering to the psyche and mental structures. The objective of this study is to make them visible and identify them in order to enrich the study of psychological alterations in victimization and thereby contribute with evidence and new findings to the scenario of psychological trauma and the management and intervention in the violent post-scenario. The method that is proposed is a qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and interpretive investigation, in which the testimonial narrative of three direct female victims is taken up. The results show alterations in terms of over-stimulation, decrease, deprivation or confusion regarding the traces of pain and suffering, suspended threat, broken proxemics, fear re-triggers and in the attack-flight system, it is appreciated that these five alterations have a common basis extreme fear. The conclusion is that these findings are included in the therapeutic treatments, thereby mitigating the alterations of the victimization and, in turn, contributing to the neuro-right by making these consequences visible in their psyche and in the mental structures, thereby seeking to give greater legal relevance to the forcefulness of the damage and the need for victimological therapeutic accompaniment, which gives the step not only to the recovery and well-being of women, but also to restoring the personal integrity that was taken from them. © 2021 Policia Nacional de Colombia.

    "Abstract": "Cognitive Technologies are currently in the focus of Neurolaw due to the possibility to investigate inner brain process allowing to better understand human behaviors. Although technologies such as Brain Computer Interface could lead the transfer of neuroscience achievements in legal studies improving, so, regulations and practice, when used with active tools as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation they could represent a threat for individuals’ rights. Indeed, these devices bring new evaluation elements in law theory and practice, but they also attract the attention of several application fields, spreading from healthcare to politics and Defense, so that Neurolaw studies should be even more interdisciplinary, considering also the frontiers in technological research, to prevent abuse of individuals’ data and information, providing legal rules and standards to regulate privacy and protect individuals’ will and rights to self-determination. This chapter focuses on Brain Computer Interface and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, as examples of frontier devices in Technology which could be used and for benefit and for damaging individuals. The study argues that still low attention is given to protect individuals from abuse of private data and from fraudulent influence of personal behaviors. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",

    "Abstract": "Advances in the use of neuroimaging in combination with A.I., and specifically the use of machine learning techniques, have led to the development of brain-reading technologies which, in the nearby future, could have many applications, such as lie detection, neuromarketing or brain-computer interfaces. Some of these could, in principle, also be used in forensic psychiatry. The application of these methods in forensic psychiatry could, for instance, be helpful to increase the accuracy of risk assessment and to identify possible interventions. This technique could be referred to as ‘A.I. neuroprediction,’ and involves identifying potential neurocognitive markers for the prediction of recidivism. However, the future implications of this technique and the role of neuroscience and A.I. in violence risk assessment remain to be established. In this paper, we review and analyze the literature concerning the use of brain-reading A.I. for neuroprediction of violence and rearrest to identify possibilities and challenges in the future use of these techniques in the fields of forensic psychiatry and criminal justice, considering legal implications and ethical issues. The analysis suggests that additional research is required on A.I. neuroprediction techniques, and there is still a great need to understand how they can be implemented in risk assessment in the field of forensic psychiatry. Besides the alluring potential of A.I. neuroprediction, we argue that its use in criminal justice and forensic psychiatry should be subjected to thorough harms/benefits analyses not only when these technologies will be fully available, but also while they are being researched and developed. © Copyright © 2020 Tortora, Meynen, Bijlsma, Tronci and Ferracuti.",

    "Abstract": "This chapter discusses privacy in terms of the experience of having made an intentional choice to disengage from another or others. It examines intentional choice to distinguish this type of disengagement from abandonment or defensive dissociation. The chapter summarizes some of the infant research concerning the active role taken by the infant in the infant-caregiver interaction as described by E. Tronick, B. Beebe and L. Lachmann, C. Trevarthen and S. Malloch, and L. Sander. It discusses the development of theory of mind, defined as the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and to others. The development of a sense of ‘privacy’ in children is difficult to describe, largely because the meaning of ‘privacy’ or ‘private’ is complicated. Whereas the ability to attribute mental states to others and oneself may play a role in one’s sense of mental privacy, another aspect of privacy is perhaps more important. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Salman Akhtar and Aisha Abbasi.",

    "Abstract": "The increasing visibility of neuroscience employed in legal contexts has rightfully prompted critical discourse regarding the boundaries of its utility. High profile debates include some extreme positions that either undermine the relevance of neuroscience or overstate its role in determining legal responsibility. Here we adopt a conciliatory attitude, reaffirming the current value of neuroscience in jurisprudence and addressing its role in shifting normative attitudes about culpability. Adopting a balanced perspective about the interaction between two dynamic fields (science and law) allows for more fruitful consideration of practical changes likely to improve the way we engage in legal decision-making. Neuroscience provides a useful platform for addressing nuanced and multifaceted deterministic factors promoting antisocial behavior. Ultimately, we suggest that shifting normative attitudes about culpability vis-à-vis advancing neuroscience are not likely to promote major changes in the way we assign legal responsibility. Rather, it helps us to shed our harshest retributivist instincts in favor of more pragmatic strategies for combating the most conspicuous patterns promoting mass incarceration and recidivism. © Copyright © 2020 Anderson and Kiehl.",

    "Abstract": "Although thinkers in political science and philosophy such as Thomas Hobbes, John Stuart Mill and Robert Nozick argued that an understanding of “free will” is crucial in considering problems related to democracy and other political institutions, recent advances in the scientific exploration of free will (often associated with rationality and consciousness) in neurobiology, neuroeconomics, and quantum decision theory have largely been ignored in political science. This is also true in recently-developed bio-psychologically-inspired approaches in political science (e.g., political psychology based on evolutionary psychology). In this conceptual review article, we first introduce current findings on the science of free will and then discuss potential implications of these findings for future research in political science. The importance of investigations into future-oriented judgment and decision making (e.g., intertemporal choice) is emphasized. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",

    "Abstract": "Between the Acts (1941) tests modernism's aesthetic investment in exploring interiority through the figure of a “village idiot.” For Woolf, so-called idiocy represents an unreadable form of mental privacy that resists incorporation into social systems of meaning. Imagined as a peculiarly inaccessible form of cognition, idiocy halts Woolf's exploration of interiority and registers private thoughts as potentially isolating rather than narratively instigating. This reticent, as opposed to exploratory, approach to the mind points to an awareness of the closeness between being captivated by others' minds and desiring to capture others, something Woolf became especially wary of at the end of her life.

    "Abstract": "In a 2004 paper, Greene and Cohen predicted that neuroscience would revolutionise criminal justice by presenting a mechanistic view of human agency that would change people’s intuitions about retributive punishment. According to their theory, this change in intuitions would in turn lead to the demise of retributivism within criminal justice systems. Their influential paper has been challenged, most notably by Morse, who has argued that it is unlikely that there will be major changes to criminal justice systems in response to neuroscience. In this paper we commence a tentative empirical enquiry into the claims of these theorists, focusing on Australian criminal justice. Our analysis of Australian cases is not supportive of claims about the demise of retributive justice, and instead suggests the possibility that neuroscience may be used by the courts to calibrate retributive desert. It is thus more consistent with the predictive claims of Morse than of Greene and Cohen. We also consider evidence derived from interviews with judges, and this leads us to consider the possibility of a backlash against evidence of brain impairment. Finally we note that change in penal aims may be occurring that is unrelated to developments in neuroscience. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Legal contexts frequently impose steep communication barriers, but because the law's ontological framework of communication views it as an atomized, transaction phenomenon, the law lacks the ability to conceptualize and describe the way in which it itself imposes systemic communication burden. To overcome this shortcoming, this article presents a model for a systemic analysis of communication within the law. Part One operationalizes a set of cognitive-communication resources necessary to navigate communication in legal contexts. Part Two uses the operational model to illustrate how systemic elements of the law pressure the cognitive resources that underlie communication. Finally, Part Three uses the model to predict how possible systemic interventions might improve communication outcomes by alleviating or reducing systemic communication burdens. Not only does this article provide a conceptual tool to articulate the law's systemic impacts on communication, the subsequent analysis offers a framework for exploring interventions that could ultimately lead to better outcomes for persons, particularly vulnerable or at-risk persons, who must navigate legal contexts. By changing how it conceptualizes communication and working to modify the communication dynamics that it itself perpetuates, the law can reduce the weight of the communication burdens that it imposes on the people within it. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

    "Abstract": "The aim of this article is twofold: Firstly, we intend to describe the classical theory of intentional agency and to analyze how the neuro-technology of brain-machine interfaces (BCI) challenges the demands of that classical theory of agency and body consciousness. BCI neuro-technology works by implanting electrodes directly into the motor brain cortex that controls movement and detect neuronal signals associated with the intention to move, what is decoded by an algorithm on a computer in real time. Thus, someone could simply think about moving a leg or an arm and the tool (a prosthesis or exoskeleton) would receive the information to translate thought into action. This is yet feasible and its applications could involve rehabilitation of motor function and the possibility of enhancing human abilities. Both applications give rise to various several ethical implications but mainly to one that we call “the ethical problem of agency”. Secondly, we briefly explore the ethics of algorithms in the context of BCI neuro-technology and the way autonomy, responsibility, and informational privacy are understood. Finally, we advocate the need for an ethical framework of principles governing neuro-technology, such as the new neuro-rights. Copyright © 2019 Aníbal Monasterio Astobiza et al.",

    "Abstract": "Some of the most compelling contemporary ethical questions surround 21st Century neuroscientific technologies. Among these, neurocognitive intervention technologies allow an unprecedented ability to alter thought. Concerns exist about their impact on individual freedom, behavior and personhood. They could also distort society, eroding core values of dignity, equality, and diversity. Potent laws are needed to anchor regulation in this rising field. The article explores how the long-neglected human right of Freedom of Thought might protect the integrity of the mind at the legal system’s highest level. Sample cases illustrate how it could be given effect ethically and legally to set boundaries for neurocognitive intervention. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Human freedom is best understood as self-determination. Free action consists of deliberation, decision, and action. The free human person deserves dignity, that is, we each deserve to be treated as a moral end and not merely as a means to someone else's end. Neurocentrist philosophy-a form of eliminative materialism-based on neuroscience, however, threatens the extinction of the human self and, thereby, threatens to turn our experience of freedom and dignity into a mere delusion. This evacuates the moral agenda of every activist liberation theology. One task of today's public theologian is to protect Cognitive Liberty, because it conceptually undergirds political, economic, and social liberation. © 2020, © 2020 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).",

    "Abstract": "Talking about neuroscience and law today no longer seems futuristic or bizarre. On the contrary it is the representation of a new sector of research, concisely referred to as neurolaw, that flourishes around the integration between two fields each characterized by a high complexity and stratification of elements, theories, links with other scientific fields. Neurolaw was born as a “branch” of bioethical and bio-juridical reflection but now it has become an autonomous sector based on an extensive spectrum of transversal and integrated knowledge. It is a work in progress whose thematic area goes from the traditional phases of the trial and of ‘law in action’ to the frontiers still to be explored of artificial intelligence. This paper tries to make a critical summary of the implications and problems that modern neuroscientific acquisitions pose to the legal dimension, starting from the fundamental theme of responsibility to the controversial perspectives opened by modern techniques of neuroenhancement and brain computer interfaces. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",

    "Abstract": "Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) re-humanize or de-humanize medicine? As AI becomes pervasive in clinical medicine, we argue that the ethical framework that sustains a responsible implementation of such technologies should be reconsidered. The emergence of AI in the clinical setting will challenge our traditional moral boundaries surrounding discussions of patient care since it is unclear how the implementation of AI will promote and enhance the humanistic dimensions of medical practice. There are reasons for concern regarding 1) the anthropological implications of AI in the clinical context; 2) the method(s) and framework(s) used to address ethical issues in medicine; and 3) the impact of AI on clinical practice, particularly in the nature of clinical judgment. These three concerns are examined in hopes of providing pointers for subsequent and more in-depth discussions regarding clinical practice but the training of future health professionals. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Since our moral and legal judgments are focused on our decisions and actions, one would expect information about the neural underpinnings of human decision-making and action-production to have a significant bearing on those judgments. However, despite the wealth of empirical data, and the public attention it has attracted in the past few decades, the results of neuroscientific research have had relatively little influence on legal practice. It is here argued that this is due, at least partly, to the discussion on the relationship of the neurosciences and law mixing up a number of separate issues that have different relevance on our moral and legal judgments. The approach here is hierarchical; more and less feasible ways in which neuroscientific data could inform such judgments are separated from each other. The neurosciences and other physical views on human behavior and decision-making do have the potential to have an impact on our legal reasoning. However, this happens in various different ways, and too often appeal to any neural data is assumed to be automatically relevant to shaping our moral and legal judgments. Our physicalist intuitions easily favor neural-level explanations to mental-level ones. But even if you were to subscribe to some reductionist variant of physicalism, it would not follow that all neural data should be automatically relevant to our moral and legal reasoning. However, the neurosciences can give us indirect evidence for reductive physicalism, which can then lead us to challenge the very idea of free will. Such a development can, ultimately, also have repercussions on law and legal practice. © Copyright © 2020 Pernu and Elzein.",

    "Abstract": "Human brain-aging is a complex, multidimensional phenomenon. Knowledge of the numerous aspects that revolve around it is therefore essential if not only the medical issues, but also the social, psychological, and legal issues related to this phenomenon are to be managed correctly. In the coming decades, it will be necessary to find solutions to the management of the progressive aging of the population so as to increase the number of individuals that achieve successful aging. The aim of this article is to provide a current overview of the physiopathology of brain aging and of the role and perspectives of neuroimaging in this context. The progressive development of neuroimaging has opened new perspectives in clinical and basic research and it has modified the concept of brain aging. Neuroimaging will play an increasingly important role in the definition of the individual's brain aging in every phase of the physiological and pathological process. However, when the process involved in age-related brain cognitive diseases is being investigated, factors that might affect this process on a clinical and behavioral level (genetic susceptibility, risks factors, endocrine changes) cannot be ignored but must, on the contrary, be integrated into a neuroimaging evaluation to ensure a correct and global management, and they are therefore discussed in this article. Neuroimaging appears important to the correct management of age-related brain cognitive diseases not only within a medical perspective, but also legal, according to a wider approach based on development of relationship between neuroscience and law. The term neurolaw, the neologism born from the relationship between these two disciplines, is an emerging field of study, that deals with various issues in the impact of neurosciences on individual rights. Neuroimaging, enhancing the detection of physiological and pathological brain aging, could give an important contribution to the field of neurolaw in elderly where the full control of cognitive and volitional functions is necessary to maintain a whole series of rights linked to legal capacity. For this reason, in order to provide the clinician and researcher with a broad view of the brain-aging process, the role of neurolaw will be introduced into the brain-aging context.

    "Abstract": "The therapeutic and rehabilitative use of neuro-technologies against disabling diseases for which common treatments are partially or completely ineffective is developing more and more rapidly. Projects for the installation of brain-computer interfaces capable of enhancing perceptions, saving memories, amplifying and canceling them selectively are now a reality. The mental domain, which has always been considered the private sphere par excellence, the last territory inaccessible even to the rampant intrusiveness of “datism”, is in serious danger. The ethical implications of such possible derives are not addressable by existing protections and rules. New specific rights are needed for the neural domain, real neuro rights, to define and realize the extent of change, one of the greatest challenges of our time, in an ethically and socially shareable way, in order not to allow violating the last bulwark of the subjective identity of humanity, the mental privacy. © 2021 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l..

    "Abstract": "This paper examines the impact that the success of some of the human enhancement goals devised by the transhumanist movement could have in the legal assessment of guilt and criminal dangerousness criminal policies. In dialogue with the neuroethical debate developed mainly in Great Britain and the USA, this paper tackles the eventual significance of transhumanism for the attribution of criminal responsibility, addressing both the concerns regarding its foundations and the likely consequences of a legal obligation to enhance. Furthermore, this paper examines the possible effects that cognitive and moral enhancement procedures could have both in the stipulation and implementation of criminal sanctions, assessing the challenges faced by voluntary and compulsory biotechnological therapies. In this regard, the paper highlights the role of individual autonomy as well as the need for further work to properly define cognitive liberty. © 2021 Centro Estudios Derecho Penal.

    "Abstract": "Rapid advancements in human neuroscience and neurotechnology open unprecedented possibilities for accessing, collecting, sharing and manipulating information from the human brain. Such applications raise important challenges to human rights principles that need to be addressed to prevent unintended consequences. This paper assesses the implications of emerging neurotechnology applications in the context of the human rights framework and suggests that existing human rights may not be sufficient to respond to these emerging issues. After analysing the relationship between neuroscience and human rights, we identify four new rights that may become of great relevance in the coming decades: the right to cognitive liberty, the right to mental privacy, the right to mental integrity, and the right to psychological continuity. © 2021 Sociedad Argentina de Analisis Filosofico.

    "Abstract": "Classic evidence admitted in the courts of justice has obvious limitations, especially because of the low reliability of eyewitness memory. For many years, neurological diseases have been considered when estimating the responsibility and imputability of the defendants. However, with the emergence of neuroscience and neurotechnology in the last 20 years, the contribution of tests based on brain diagnostic techniques has increased exponentially with different purposes: attenuation or exoneration criminal responsibility, validation of witnesses, recognition of physical evidence and crime scene, acceptability of the members of the jury, etc. In this article we propose a review of the scientific evidence that may or may not support these applications of neurotechnology in courts, as well as the ethical and legal implications that this new paradigm may imply. © 2020 Universitat Ramon Llull.

    "Abstract": "Although decoding the content of mental states is currently unachievable, technologies such as neural interfaces, affective computing systems, and digital behavioral technologies enable increasingly reliable statistical associations between certain data patterns and mental activities such as memories, intentions, and emotions. Furthermore, Artificial Intelligence enables the exploration of these activities not just retrospectively but also in a real-time and predictive manner. In this article, we introduce the notion of 'mental data', defined as any data that can be organized and processed to make inferences about the mental states of a person, including their cognitive, affective and conative states. Further, we analyze existing legal protections for mental data by considering the lawfulness of their processing in light of different legal bases and purposes, with special focus on the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We argue that the GDPR is an adequate tool to mitigate risks related to mental data processing. However, we recommend that interpreters focus on processing characteristics, rather than merely on the category of data at issue. Finally, we call for a 'Mental Data Protection Impact Assessment', a specific data protection impact assessment designed to better assess and mitigate the risks to fundamental rights and freedoms associated with the processing of mental data.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

    "Abstract": "The present study reviews the contribution of neuroimaging tests in the American criminal process, whose contribution varies greatly depending on the stage of the process in which they are used: while the neurocognitive data have practically no relevance in the phase of competency to stand trial or for culpability, in the sentencing phase they are becoming a powerful weapon for mitigation, especially in those cases in which is discussed the death penalty. However, as we will conclude, it would be in this guilt phase, as the basis for the incomplete defense of diminished capacity when mental disorders are discussed, especially when they affect the sphere of personality, where these tests could have a greater judicial impact, in contrast with its more mediatic uses and, at the same time, unfortunate, like the one carried out by the famous lie detection technique. © 2020 Centro Estudios Derecho Penal.

    "Abstract": "After a legislative process of more than two years, the Law No. 21.383 has been enacted in the Republic of Chile (October 14, 2021), which amends the Constitution in order to incorporate the protection of people against scientific and technological developments, specifically in its “cerebral” dimension. This constitutional reform reflects the concern about the way in which neurotechnological progress could impact on society, an issue that has prompted the emergence of a doctrine aimed at protecting the implicit legal rights that would be threatened in this context, expressed in the concept of neuro-rights. This paper reflects on the conceptual and legal bases of the message contained in the project that gives rise to this first constitutional reform to protect “neuro-rights” at world level, as well as on the text of the recently enacted norm. General and specific comments on the constitutional reform are included in the work in order to contribute to the discussion and progress in the development of legal frameworks that protect people from the threats of potential misuse of various invasive and non-invasive neurotechnologies. © 2022, Pontificia Universidad Catolica Argentina.

    "Abstract": "The 2005 Mental Capacity Act of England and Wales provides a description in statute law of a test determining if a person lacks “mental capacity” to take a particular decision and describes how the “best interests” of such a person should be determined. The Act established a new Court of Protection (CoP) to hear cases related to the Act and to rule on disputes over mental capacity. The court gathers a range of evidence, including reports from clinicians and experts. Human rights organisations and others have raised concerns about the nature of assessments for incapacity, including the role of brain investigations and psychometric tests. Aim: Describe use and interpretation of structured measures of psychological and brain function in CoP cases, to facilitate standardisation and improvement of practices, both in the courtroom and in non-legal settings. Method: Quantitative review of case law using all CoP judgments published until 2019. The judgments (n = 408) were read to generate a subset referring to structured testing (n = 50). These were then examined in detail to extract the nature of the measurements, circumstances of their use and features of interpretation by the court. Results: The 408 judgments contained 146 references to structured measurement of psychological or brain function, spread over 50 cases. 120/146 (82.2%) referred to “impairment of mind or brain,” with this being part of assessment for incapacity in 58/146 (39.7%). Measurement referred on 25/146 (17.1%) occasions to “functional decision-making abilities.” Structured measures were used most commonly by psychiatrists and psychologists. Psychological measurements comprised 66.4% of measures. Neuroimaging and electrophysiology were presented for diagnostic purposes only. A small number of behavioural measures were used for people with disorders of consciousness. When assessing incapacity, IQ and the Mini-Mental-State Examination were the commonest measures. A standardised measure of mental capacity itself was employed just once. Judges rarely integrated measurements in their capacity determinations. Conclusion: Structured testing of brain and psychological function is used in limited ways in the Court of Protection. Whilst there are challenges in creating measures of capacity, we highlight an opportunity for the neuroscience community to improve objectivity in assessment, inside and outside the courtroom. © Copyright © 2020 McWilliams, Fleming, David and Owen.",

    "Abstract": "Brain reading technologies are rapidly being developed in a number of neuroscience fields. These technologies can record, process, and decode neural signals. This has been described as ‘mind reading technology’ in some instances, especially in popular media. Should the public at large, be concerned about this kind of technology? Can it really read minds? Concerns about mind-reading might include the thought that, in having one’s mind open to view, the possibility for free deliberation, and for self-conception, are eroded where one isn’t at liberty to privately mull things over. Themes including privacy, cognitive liberty, and self-conception and expression appear to be areas of vital ethical concern. Overall, this article explores whether brain reading technologies are really mind reading technologies. If they are, ethical ways to deal with them must be developed. If they are not, researchers and technology developers need to find ways to describe them more accurately, in order to dispel unwarranted concerns and address appropriately those that are warranted. © 2020, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The use of cognitive enhancement technologies raises not only ethical, but also legal questions. Numerous scholars have expressed concerns that these technologies may pose a threat to basic human rights, especially the individual's right to self-determination. In response to this worry, the concept of \"cognitive liberty\" (as a right to be and not to be subjected to enhancing procedures) has been introduced. Many commentators have wondered how cognitive enhancement interventions would change basic concepts and principles of criminal law and criminal responsibility. Yet, little attention has been given so far to the implications of cognitive enhancement technologies for the civil law domain. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap. First we remind the basic tenants of the continental law doctrine on civil liability through the perceptive of the German, French, and Polish legal systems. Second, we identify main challenges the use of cognitive enhancement technologies poses for civil liability. We analyse three elements justifying a claim for damages, namely unlawful conduct of an agent, damage, and causation. We focus on the first and the third one. Regarding the first element, we discuss the problem of agency of a cognitively enhanced individual, especially the influence of his or her enhanced cognition on the standard of due care and - what follows - conception of negligence. As to the third element, we analyse the causal relationship between the fact of an enhancement and the damages caused by the enhanced agent. We illustrate these theoretical inquiries with an example of a surgeon who performs a complicated operation under the influence of 200mg of modafinil. In the last part of the paper, we offer some general comments on possible developments of civil law in the era of cognitive enhancement technologies. © Peter Lang GmbH International Academic Publishers Berlin 2019.

    "Abstract": "Many theorists have expressed the view that current or future applications of neurotechnology may prompt serious ethical problems in terms of privacy. This article concerns the question as to whether involuntary neurotechnological mind reading can plausibly be held to violate a person’s moral right to mental privacy. It is argued that it is difficult to specify what a violation of a right to mental privacy amounts to in a way that is consistent with the fact that we usually regard natural mind reading as morally unproblematic. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

    "Abstract": "The present volume is the result of a feeling of dissatisfaction with current ‘discourses of the brain,’ from the by-now classic project of neurophilosophy (as discussed and partially defined below) to more recent revisions such as neurophenomenology, embodied cognitive science, but also more theoretical projects such as critical neuroscience, and the welter of empirical ŉeuro’-boosted fields that have emerged in recent years, such as neuroethics, neurolaw, and, differently, neurofeminism. Some of these discourses are, of course, featured here, as well as more historical and evaluative contributions, in the name of conceptual, empirical, and methodological pluralism. The volume has, to be sure, no claim to offering some kind of exhaustive, synoptic overview of an entire field - for indeed, there is no field. That is, when neuro-scientists from Roger Sperry and John Eccles to Jean-Pierre Changeux and Gerald Edelman wax philosophical, it is not as if their theoretical terms are clearly demarcated and can be transferred or treated cumulatively between their various inquiries, any more than when Patricia Churchland, Andy Clark, Evan Thompson, or Cordelia Fine address issues in cognitive architecture, embodiment, or social discourse on brains. In addition, “the question of what counts as a good explanation of cognition has not been settled decisively.\". © Palgrave Macmillan, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited 2014.",

The technology has been subjected to a number of criticisms already: it has the potential to violate three distinct rights, and researchers have shown that it can be deceived through intentional suppression of memories.

    "Abstract": "The neurosciences not only challenge assumptions about the mind's place in the natural world but also urge us to reconsider its role in the normative world. Based on mind-brain dualism, the law affords only one-sided protection: it systematically protects bodies and brains, but only fragmentarily minds and mental states. The fundamental question, in what ways people may legitimately change mental states of others, is largely unexplored in legal thinking. With novel technologies to both intervene into minds and detect mental activity, the law should, we suggest, introduce stand alone protection for the inner sphere of persons. We shall address some metaphysical questions concerning physical and mental harm and demonstrate gaps in current doctrines, especially in regard to manipulative interferences with decision-making processes. We then outline some reasons for the law to recognize a human right to mental liberty and propose elements of a novel criminal offence proscribing severe interventions into other minds. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In Japan, we are now discussing neuroethics [We can know the detailed contents of neuroethics and the various problems by Illes (Neuroethics-defining the issues in theory, practice and policy, 2006). And concerning the situations of neuroethics in Japan, see Fukushi et al. (Neuroscience Research 57:10-16, 2007)], but have not yet argued on neurolaw in earnest. Right from the beginning, neuroethics in itself is a very new field, which has only begun within the last few years in the world [See Chiaki Kagawa (Gendaishiso (Modernthought), 34(11):188ff, 2006), Chiaki Kagawa (Gendaishiso (Modernthought), 36(7):69ff, 2008)]. Also neurolaw is a newer field and concept of law, so we are now discussing on the problem of free will, the criminal responsibility, and the problem of the limit of intervention into human brain in the field of human experimentation or enhancement as much as possible. In the field of Bioethics, however, we have accumulations of arguments on neuroethics in bioethics in Japan. Therefore, in this paper I must start to follow the situations of arguments on neuroethics in Japan, and then advance toward legal issues in the field of neuroscience in Japan, and finally consider the way to legal regulation. The decisive question is whether it is possible to shift from neuroethics to neurolaw in Japan. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012. All rights are reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Neurolaw is the approach that attempts to apply recent progress in neuroscience to the classical conceptions of law, often with the aim of pushing legal institutions (especially in criminal law) to be more in line with scientific knowledge. It is essentially a process of naturalization of the law, which also applies to punishment, its aims, its methods of implementation and its justification. A relevant line of naturalization of criminal law relies on developments in neuroscience so as to try to prove that (if not always, at least most times) our actions are not free according to the classic definition of freedom - where the agent is capable of knowingly, voluntarily and consciously undertaking a course of action by choosing between alternatives. According to the proponents of this view, one cannot but follow the logical sequence deriving from the experimental data, which leads to the unavoidable pragmatic conclusion of choosing a consequentialistic kind of law and punishment. Consequentialist punishment is deemed to be more humane because it is not afflictive and is only targeted to protect society. But the fact that the charged person is regarded as more mad than bad, so to speak, turns her into a sort of \"broken machine\", with the risk of legitimizing preventive treatments or ones of indefinite duration. The objections to this approach are therefore related to the gaps of knowledge we still have, to the risks of \"political\" abuse, and to the Strawsonian line of thought for which we cannot treat our fellow human beings as broken machines to be repaired, depriving them of their nature of free and rational agents (except in exceptional and rare cases). I suggest a more nuanced assessment of these possible developments and defend a moderate form of retributivism.",

    "Abstract": "There are many kinds of neural prostheses available or being researched today. In most cases they are intended to cure or improve the condition of patients affected by some cerebral deficiency. In other cases, their goal is to provide new means to maintain or improve an individual's normal performance. In all these circumstances, one of the possible risks is that of violating the privacy of brain contents (which partly coincide with mental contents) or of depriving individuals of full control over their thoughts (mental states), as the latter are at least partly detectable by new prosthetic technologies. Given the (ethical) premise that the absolute privacy and integrity of the most relevant part of one's brain data is (one of) the most valuable and inviolable human right(s), I argue that a (technical) principle should guide the design and regulation of new neural prostheses. The premise is justified by the fact that whatever the coercion, the threat or the violence undergone, the person can generally preserve a \"private repository\" of thought in which to defend her convictions and identity, her dignity, and autonomy. Without it, the person may end up in a state of complete subjection to other individuals. The following functional principle is that neural prostheses should be technically designed and built so as to prevent such outcomes. They should: (a) incorporate systems that can find and signal the unauthorized detection, alteration, and diffusion of brain data and brain functioning; (b) be able to stop any unauthorized detection, alteration, and diffusion of brain data. This should not only regard individual devices, but act as a general (technical) operating principle shared by all interconnected systems that deal with decoding brain activity and brain functioning. © 2018 Lavazza.",

    "Abstract": "Whereas the past few years have repeatedly been referred to as the \"era of biotechnology\", most recently the impression has emerged that at least the same degree of attention is being paid to the latest developments in the field of neurosciences. It has now become nearly impossible to maintain an overview of the number of research projects dealing with the functionality of the brain - for example concerning its organizational structure - or projects dealing with the topics of legal responsibility, brain-computer interface applications, neuromarketing, lie detection or mind reading. These procedures are connected to a number of legal questions concerning the framework conditions of research projects as well as the right approach to the findings generated. Given the primary importance of the topic for the latest developments, it is essential to compare the different legal systems and strategies that they offer for dealing with these legal implications. Therefore, the book International Neurolaw - A Comparative Analysis contains several country reports from around the world, as well as those of international organizations such as UNESCO, in order to show the different legal approaches to the topic and possible interactions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

    "Abstract": "This article takes relevant evidences from contemporary cognitive sciences - especially behavioural and fMRI studies - to understand the argumentative elaboration of criminal intent (dolo) and the selectivity of criminal policy, politically and morally focused on the psychological and individual level. Both the psychological elements, which underlie conceptualization and classification of intentional crimes, and the biases that affect the judgment of subjective elements adscription are issued with an empirical and interdisciplinary approach. So it is possible to explore the natural and spontaneous association of legal institutes, criminal especially, and some readily available moral conceptions; also the limits of efficacy of some traditional cognitive guarantees within the criminal process. The employed methodology was mainly bibliographical review, both on neuroscience, mainly, on neural correlates of Theory of Mind, and behavioural psychology, with emphasis on intervenient factors on attribution of knowledge, will and intention (mental states) to agents, and its relationship with the social (normative) meaning of his action. Some asymmetries on actions evaluations were identified, in a way that signalizes other factors beyond the agent's mental states (knowledge and will) to play an important role on their moral status - actually, those same states may play a role not as premises on moral judgement, but to further justify some initial intuitive reprobation. A psychological base for conditional intent (dolo eventual) was also identified, according to the neural processing of negative side effects of some actions. Furthermore, there is a noticeable effect of the agent's previous record on the evaluation of blame, intentionality and of the causal contribution of his action to the verified result. Finally, the interpretation of an action as intentional may vary depending on its occurrence along with a harmful event, or its being only a violation of social norm. These results are important to criminal law, especially to guide the never-ending efforts to make its guarantees effective. © 2018 Centro Universitario de Brasilia. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of the chapter is to draw attention to a fundamental right that is neglected in the law but that is highly relevant for neuroethics: cognitive liberty or freedom of thought. Although an internationally accepted human right, it has not gained practical legal importance. However, any regulation of neurotechnologies has to be evaluated in its light. As the right is unfamiliar to policy makers and even to many lawyers and legal scholars, its historical development and the main arguments for its recognition are sketched. Furthermore, some suggestions for its interpretation, scope, and contours are forwarded and remaining open questions identified. According to international human rights law, the right is of absolute nature so that interferences cannot be justified for interests of the common good or paternalistic reasons. Whether this strict prohibition of intervening into other persons’ minds can and should be sustained even in light of putative pressing public interests and various neuroethical considerations is one of the novel questions neuroscience poses for the law. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to highlight the rationale behind the use of data from neuroscience, particularly neuroimaging, in psychiatric legal expert procedures and their interference with the mind-brain problem. The critical argument is that the employment of mental health evaluation of the defendants and/or witnesses as collected with clinical assessment methods in court proceedings should not be considered irrespective to the data from neuroscience. Essentially, neuroscience methods belong to the domain of nomothetic (natural explanatory) knowledge, whereas clinical evaluation methods in psychiatry belong to the domain of intra- and inter-subjective narratives. There exists an explanatory gap between those two groups of disciplines which concerns the ability to translate and integrate data across diverse methodological and terminological systems. Furthermore, it depends largely on the implicit positions in the mind-brain debate and the brain-to-behavior connections, which reflect on the professional and legal reasoning in terms of prioritizing certain solutions or approaches over another in the expert judgements. There are described those tacit positions adopted in the mind-brain debate by different traditions in psychiatry, with special emphasis on reductive and non-reductive forms of physicalism. In conclusion, a cognitive pluralist stance is adopted which sets priority for the supervenience theory of mind. © 2018 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.",

    "Abstract": "Brain-imaging technologies have posed the problem of breaching our brain privacy. Until the invention of those technologies, many of us entertained the idea that nothing can threaten our mental privacy, as long as we kept it, for each of us has private access to his or her own mind but no access to any other. Yet, philosophically, the issue of private, mental accessibility appears to be quite unsettled, as there are still many philosophers who reject the idea of private, mental accessibility. I have attempted to refute such rejections and to establish this idea on firmer grounds. My arguments in this paper show that brain imaging allows no access to our mind and that mind privacy is quite different from brain privacy, as the latter can be breached by brain imaging, whereas the former cannot. A reduction of the mind to the body inescapably fails, as there is a categorial difference between mind and body or brain, which is compatible with their inseparability. Brain imaging cannot enable one to “read” the mind or to breach our mental privacy. There is no external access to one’s mind. Each of us has exclusive access to his or her own mind. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

    "Abstract": "The voices of people with lived experience of emotional distress, mental differences, and/or psychiatric treatment are often excluded from traditional psychiatric research and literature. This chapter will highlight the importance of not only including but centering those perspectives, with a focus on perspectives that aim to redefine and reclaim the traits, characteristics, experiences, and phenomena categorized as “mental illness.” Specifically, the author will introduce the Mad Pride movement and neurodiversity paradigm, two frameworks that recognize the value and meaning of the traits commonly perceived as symptoms of mental disorders. Both Mad Pride and neurodiversity posit that these traits are not indicators of pathology or disease but rather forms of diversity and parts of the human experience. This chapter will present arguments from Mad Pride and neurodiversity activists that challenge some of the dominant assumptions underlying the traditional model of psychiatric care. The author will then discuss how the ideas of Mad Pride and neurodiversity can be applied in four different examples: hallucinations and extreme states, autism, multiplicity, and suicide. The issue of coercion within the mental health system will then be explored from a Mad Pride and neurodiversity standpoint. Finally, the chapter will present suggestions for incorporating these perspectives into the practice of critical psychiatry © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",

    "Abstract": "Improvements in our ability to identify brain function as it is occurring through brain imaging have brought to the forefront the issue of mental privacy. Several authors have cited potential infringement on privacy as one of the primary ethical issues related to the application of brain imaging technology to clinical, research, and legal contexts. I challenge the argument that the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) poses a threat to mental privacy and that this type of privacy requires extra protections. I review all the positions about the nature of mental states that establish a category of mental privacy and conclude that none of those views can support both the claim that there is a category of mental privacy and that this type of privacy can be violated through the use of brain imaging. I further argue that the only position about the nature of mental states that erases the epistemological gap between introspection and third-person access to our inner states is eliminative materialism. Eliminativism, however, does this by denying the categories of folk psychology, including the category of mental privacy. Finally, I argue that because no view about the nature of mental states can support the argument that ‘brain reading’ will result in ‘mindreading,’ fMRI does not pose a threat to mental privacy. I conclude that special protections for mental privacy are not required because informational privacy already protects, at least in principle, the privacy of information about patients and about research participants in whatever way it is obtained. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

    "Abstract": "As the studies in the great field of neurosciences increase, its importance in the concept of responsibility becomes more evident. Neuroethics, as a study of the neural basis of moral responsibility, is closely related to the most recent studies of paleoanthropology, cultural anthropology and cognition in primates. The intercession between law and the neurosciences, having been first thought as a mere use of neuroscientific procedures in legal practice, is now beginning to raise the possibility of an authentic neurolaw: it becomes increasingly clear that there is a biological substrate that makes us moral beings in a specific way and that does not arise by a cultural construction – not as if we were, at birth, “a blank slate”. The question that we may now discuss, in the intercession between law and neuroscience, is whether there is an authentic neurolaw: a factor, or set of factors, that makes us innate legally responsible beings. © 2017, Yozmot Heiliger Ltd.

    "Abstract": "Law regulates human behaviour, a phenomenon about which neuroscience has much to say. Neuroscience can tell us whether a defendant suffers from a brain abnormality, or injury and it can correlate these neural deficits with criminal offending. Using fMRI and other technologies it might indicate whether a witness is telling lies or the truth. It can further propose neuro-interventions to ‘change’ the brains of offenders and so to reduce their propensity to offend. And, it can make suggestions about whether a defendant knows or merely suspects a prohibited state of affairs; so, drawing distinctions among the mental states that are central to legal responsibility. Each of these matters has philosophical import; is a neurological ‘deficit’ inculpatory or exculpatory; what is the proper role for law if the mind is no more than the brain; is lying really a brain state and can neuroscience really ‘read’ the brain? In this edited collection, leading contributors to the field provide new insights on these matters, bringing to light the great challenges that arise when disciplinary boundaries merge. • Covers both philosophical and practical implications, helping readers to draw considered conclusions • Written in an accessible way for those with no background in neuroscience, helping lawyers, philosophers and others understand the implications of neuroscience for the law • Includes insights about the conceptual limitations of neuroscience, helping readers to see the difficulties that arise when disciplinary boundaries merge. © Cambridge University Press 2018.",

    "Abstract": "In 2009, Mark Walker first proposed the Genetic Virtue Project, advancing that science should explore using genetic engineering to eliminate moral evils just as it attempts to eliminate natural ones like disease. This seemed like an issue for the far future given the unique challenges. Walker focused on the wrong aspect of personhood, however, as moral engineering of the brain appears to be a more likely possibility. As early aspects of moral engineering the brain are in development, especially through the manipulation of the neural correlates of religious and political beliefs, emotions, and behaviors, I consider several issues surrounding this project so as to protect individual rights and prevent future harms. I advance an internal criterion for the field called Acceptability Across Ideologies to serve as a guide to protect against coercive and harmful technologies and analyze how current laws protecting cognitive liberty are lacking and in need of revision. © 2018 Graduate Theological Union (CTNS Program).",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this chapter is to consider the hypothesis that neurobiological accounts of behavior will affect the law, not just in the criminal context where there is evidence that neurobiological explanations may affect judgments of criminal responsibility, but also in how disability in the law is defined. The definition of disability is important as it sets the parameters of entitlements to disability benefits and the scope of legal protection from discrimination in human rights law. The chapter explores the impact of neurobiological explanations of behavioral conditions in this context. It presents cases involving addictions to gambling, sex, or the Internet, and nicotine to illustrate how medicalization, and occasionally neurobiological explanations, account for disabilities that ought to be accommodated rather than punished. © Oxford University Press 2017.",

    "Abstract": "In a not too far past, the so-called cognitive neuroscience started to spread its influence also over issues regarding law and justice, arousing a general interest. As a consequence, a new expression, neurolaw has been coined. The author used to point out that an imprecise generalization should not be applied to the ontological problems of law and justice and that they instead should be kept separated. Starting from the basis of Descartes' thought, the author underlies how this construction was challenged about a century ago by the psychoanalysis, which demonstrated that human actions are strongly conditioned by the unconscious impulses.The essay continues to throw some light on the paths leading to both the comprehension and the use of single disciplines, first, the different branches of law.Thus, the author shows how difficult it is today to deal with the subject of the interpretation which-together with the efficiency of the juridical system-is still now the core of the legal world and in particular in the fields of the philosophy of law, in the general theory and in the so-called juridical dogmatic. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland and G.

    "Abstract": "Criminal convictions require proof that a prohibited act was performed in a statutorily specified mental state. Different legal consequences, including greater punishments, are mandated for those who act in a state of knowledge, compared with a state of recklessness. Existing research, however, suggests people have trouble classifying defendants as knowing, rather than reckless, even when instructed on the relevant legal criteria. We used a machine-learning technique on brain imaging data to predict, with high accuracy, which mental state our participants were in. This predictive ability depended on both the magnitude of the risks and the amount of information about those risks possessed by the participants. Our results provide neural evidence of a detectable difference in the mental state of knowledge in contrast to recklessness and suggest, as a proof of principle, the possibility of inferring from brain data in which legally relevant category a person belongs. Some potential legal implications of this result are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "As we become more and more enhanced with cyborg technology, significant issues of law and policy are raised. For example, as cyborg devices implanted within the body create a class of people with enhanced motor and computational abilities, how should the law and policy respond when the abilities of such people surpass those of the general population? And what basic human and legal rights should be afforded to people equipped with cyborg technology as they become more machine and less biology? As other issues of importance, if a neuroprosthetic device is accessed by a third party and done to edit one’s memory or to plant a new memory in one’s mind, or even to place an ad for a commercial product in one’s consciousness, should there be a law of cognitive liberty or of “neuro-advertising” that applies? This paper discusses laws and statutes enacted across several jurisdictions which apply to cyborg technologies with a particular emphasis on legal doctrine which relates to neuroprosthetic devices. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

    "Abstract": "The relationship between belief in free will (BFW) and third-party punishment (TPP) of criminal norm violations has been the subject of great debate among philosophers, criminologists and neuroscientists. We combined a TPP task with functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how lay people's BFW might affect their punishment of hypothetical criminal offenses varying in affective content. Our results revealed that people with strong BFW punished more harshly than people with weak BFW, but only in low affective cases, likely driven by a more robust commitment to moral responsibility. This effect was mirrored by a stronger activation in the right temporo-parietal junction, a region presumably involved in attentional selection to salient stimuli and attribution of temporary intentions and beliefs of others. But, for high affective cases, the BFW-based behavioral and neural differences disappeared. Both groups similarly punished high affective cases and showed higher activation in the right insula. The right insula is typically activated during aversive interoceptive-emotional processing for extreme norm violations. Our results demonstrated that the impact of BFW on TPP is context-dependent; perhaps explaining in part why the philosophical debate between free will and determinism is so stubbornly persistent. © The Author (2013).

    "Abstract": "Objectives: This paper sets out to examine the way in which neuroscientific knowledge and techniques have been used in some European courts, in order to assess their impact on the assessment of criminal responsibility and to anticipate potential misuse of neuroscience in the courts. Method: We conducted a case-law search and examined two European cases in which neuroscientific techniques were used in order to prove the diminished responsibility or irresponsibility of the accused. Results: After reviewing these cases we concluded that there were significant difficulties and limitations of technical/scientific, conceptual and legal nature, concerning the use of neuroscience for the assessment of responsibility. Discussion: Neuroscientific data, no matter how accurate and reliable may become, will only make sense in the quest for the assessment of criminal responsibility if they are contextualized and supplemented with data collected from other levels of analysis. Conclusion: Despite the importance of the contribution of neuroscience to forensic assessments for a more refined understanding of the complex interaction between the brain, mental states and behaviour, the use of neuroscientific evidence in legal contexts will not dispense with the need to define the limits of responsibility and irresponsibility of the accused. It is a social, moral, political and, ultimately, legal question. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.",

    "Abstract": "Advances in neuroimaging and brain-machine interfacing (BMI) increasingly enable the large-scale collection and further processing of neural data as well as the modulation of neural processes. In parallel, progresses in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in machine learning, create new possibilities for decoding and analyzing neural data for various purposes including health monitoring, screening for disease, cognitive enhancement, device control and delivery of targeted neurointerventions. As neural data become part of the digital ecosystem, it is important to assess the level of preparedness of our current ethical and digital infrastructures. This contribution discusses some major ethical, technical and regulatory issues associated with neural data analytics and delineates a roadmap for responsible innovation in this sector. This contribution will review a variety of themes including mind reading, mental privacy, cybersecurity in commercial BMI, and issues of neurotechnology governance. In addition, a framework for responsible innovation and governance will be presented. © 2019, Tipolito Subalpina. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Advances in neuroscientific techniques have found increasingly broader applications, including in legal neuroscience (or \"neurolaw\"), where experts in the brain sciences are called to testify in the courtroom. But does the incursion of neuroscience into the legal sphere constitute a threat to individual liberties? And what legal protections are there against such threats? In this paper, we outline individual rights as they interact with neuroscientific methods. We then proceed to examine the current uses of neuroscientific evidence, and ultimately determine whether the rights of the individual are endangered by such approaches. Based on our analysis, we conclude that while federal evidence rules constitute a substantial hurdle for the use of neuroscientific evidence, more ethical safeguards are needed to protect against future violations of fundamental rights. Finally, we assert that it will be increasingly imperative for the legal and neuroscientific communities to work together to better define the limits, capabilities, and intended direction of neuroscientific methods applicable for use in law. © 2017 Kraft and Giordano.",

    "Abstract": "Neuroimaging techniques can generate a variety of kinds of personal information. This chapter focuses on the potential for neuroimaging to threaten privacy by revealing mental content and discusses the scientific and ethical issues that should be considered in a neuroethical analysis of neuroimaging that may infringe on privacy. Here these considerations are illustrated with a discussion of the scientific and ethical issues that arise when trying to use neuroimaging technologies for lie detection in real-world applications. Although current methods do not significantly threaten mental privacy, it is possible that privacy rights could be infringed with further developments in neuroimaging. However, this area is highly undertheorized; more work on the foundations of the right to privacy is needed. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",

    "Abstract": "Based on the study of neuroscientific developments and innovations, examined from different angles, this Handbook provides a comprehensive overview of the international neuroethical debate, and offers unprecedented insights into the impact of neuroscientific research, diagnosis, and therapy. Neuroethics – as a multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary endeavor – examines the implications of the neurosciences for human beings in general and for their self-understanding and their social interactions in particular. The range of approaches adopted in neuroethics and thus in this handbook includes but is not limited to historical, anthropological, ethical, philosophical, theological, sociological and legal approaches. The Handbook deals with a plethora of topics, divided into in three parts: the first part contains discussions of theories of neuroethics and how neuroscience impacts on our understanding of personal identity, free will, and other philosophical concepts. The second part is dedicated to issues involved in current and future clinical applications of neurosciences, such as brain stimulation, brain imaging, prosthetics, addiction, and psychiatric ethics. The final part deals with neuroethics and society and includes chapters on neurolaw, neurotheology, neuromarketing, and enhancement. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",

    "Abstract": "The powerful trend to use the achievements of medical science and biotechnologies not only for treatment but also for human enhancement was formed at the turn of the millennia. One manifestation of this trend is the phenomenon of \"academic doping\", which is the application of a variety of medical (particularly pharmacological) means for betterment of cognitive capacities. In neurotics, which emerged at the intersection of bioethics and neuroscience, academic doping and related practices are usually named as cognitive enhancement (Cognitive Enhancement, CE) technologies. Modern medicine does not have sufficient knowledge to prove the efficacy and safety of CE means. Therefore, the basic moral principle -\"First, do no harm!\"-commands medical professionals to refrain from the use of CE products in healthy people. The article notes that the lack of knowledge could be not only quantitative but also qualitative. There is a fundamental contradiction between the requirements of reliability and validity of the obtained in experiments knowledge. This contradiction is interpreted not as a temporary condition, but as a basic one. It represents complexity in organization and activities of human consciousness. The attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was discussed as a characteristic example of CE technologies medicalization that is going in consumer societies. Specific features of the modern type of biopower were also discussed. CE technologies consumers are constructing themselves as subjects not in power of true knowledge and effective control (as it was the case in classical medicine), but in consumption of signs of body power inscribed by commercials and different kinds of consumerist society mythologies. Biopower spreads as systematic manipulation of signs (J. Baudrillard). © 2018 Izdatel'stvo Nauka. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "This volume illustrates to the public, and legal experts, the basic principles of the field of neuroscience, that commonly goes under the name of Neurolaw. First, it illustrates the relationship between neuroscience, natural sciences and social sciences. Furthermore, it highlights numerous problems concerning the fundamental philosophical concepts used by Neurolaw and evaluates the validity of the method and the limits of a neuroscientific approach to the problems of law and justice.The volume explores the possibility of application of these concepts on the fundamentals of the general theory of law and legal dogmatics. It also examines the main problems of Neurolaw in relation to public, private, criminal and procedural law. In conclusion, the book follows a systematic method that makes it an thorough manual for the introduction to Neurolaw. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland and G.

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, there is an increasing discussion of the effect of a new type of science, the one that is postmodern with complex dynamic systems, in all the sciences. The new science encourages scientific disciplines to seek dialogue, connections and integration with each other. Therefore, it is very important to be open, connected and integrated. It is believed that interdisciplinary becomes more and more important concept in science. Scientists should change, and they are changing. The changing processes are not fast and usually contain mistakes. Thus, it should be remembered to be critical and learn from mistakes. The question arises whether there is an integrated science, and in fact, there is. For example, neuroscience has become interdisciplinary with many connections to other sciences. These new associations cause great debate not only in the research domain of science technology, but as well in social science, arts and humanities research. In this paper, the author wishes to review the dialogue of social sciences with neuroscience. Social sciences are encouraged both internally and externally to be open to other sciences. Examples of this are neuroeconomics, neurolaw, neuropsychology, neuromanagement and neuroeducation. Specialists in economics, law, psychology, management and education science talk to those from neurosciencein search for clearer understanding and closeness to the truth than they had before by using the achievements of neuroscience. Thus, the question is raised whether the dialogue between neuroscience and social sciences is inevitable. © Vilnius University, 2002-2016 © Brno University of Technology, 2002-2016 © University of Latvia, 2002-2016.",

    "Abstract": "The central debate in the field of neurolaw has focused on two claims. Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen argue that we do not have free will and that advances in neuroscience will eventually lead us to stop blaming people for their actions. Stephen Morse, by contrast, argues that we have free will and that the kind of advances Greene and Cohen envision will not and should not affect the law. I argue that neither side has persuasively made the case for or against a revolution in the way the law treats responsibility. There will, however, be a neurolaw revolution of a different sort. It will not necessarily arise from radical changes in our beliefs about criminal responsibility but from a wave of new brain technologies that will change society and the law in many ways, three of which I describe here: First, as new methods of brain imaging improve our ability to measure distress, the law will ease limitations on recoveries for emotional injuries. Second, as neuroimaging gives us better methods of inferring people's thoughts, we will have more laws to protect thought privacy but less actual thought privacy. Finally, improvements in artificial intelligence will systematically change how law is written and interpreted. Copyright © 2014 Adam J. Kolber.",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, a host of normative questions have surfaced in the wake of rapid progress in the neurosciences and have entered the sphere of legal discourse. They continue to confront legal scholars and increasingly also courts with problems that strike many lawyers as rather unfamiliar within their accustomed domain. Some of these problems seem to be entirely new, others appear to shed new light on venerable and unresolved matters of the law and its philosophical foundations. In a rough and ready differentiation, one can distinguish three perspectives from which to assess these developments. Neuroscience provides (1) new insights (into old metaphysical problems of mind and brain), (2) new ways to peer into, and (3) new ways to intervene in the brain (and hence, perhaps, the mind). The realm of (1) may be fittingly exemplified by the recent outpouring of neuroscientific contributions to the age-old philosophical question of freedom of the will and the attached problem of legal responsibility; (2) refers to new methods of neuroimaging, visualising structural as well as functional features of the living (and working) brain; and (3) points, most notably, to new ways of enhancing mental capacities of healthy people by altering neural circuits in their brains. – Each of the entries in the present section contributes to (at least) one of these spheres of new questions.  © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",

    "Abstract": "Advances in neuroscience might make it possible to develop techniques for directly altering offenders' brains, in order to make offenders more responsible and law-abiding. The idea of using such techniques within the criminal justice system can seem intuitively troubling, even if they were more effective in preventing crime than traditional methods of rehabilitation. One standard argument against this use of brain interventions is that it would undermine the individual's free will. This paper maintains that 'free will' (at least, as that notion is understood by those who adopt the influential compatibilist approach) is an inadequate basis for explaining what is problematic about some direct brain interventions. This paper then defends an alternative way of objecting to certain kinds of direct brain interventions, focusing on the relationship between the offender and the state rather than the notion of free will. It opposes the use of interventions which aim to enhance 'virtue responsibility' (by instilling particular values about what is right and wrong), arguing that this would objectify offenders. In contrast, it argues that it may be acceptable to use direct brain interventions to enhance 'capacity responsibility' (i.e. to strengthen the abilities necessary for the exercise of responsible agency, such as self-control). Finally it considers how to distinguish these different kinds of responsibility enhancement. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The present work aims to analyze the impacts that recent discoveries of Neuroscience bring to Legal Science. To do so, it is initially intended to explain how the study of law is organized from some ideas that are intuitive and considered as consolidated, although in practice they do not prove as functional as in theory. In the sequence, it is intended to present some of the recent advances of Neuroscience and Behavioral Psychology, in order to show how they alow to question many of the beliefs on which Legal Science is founded. As a development, through a bibliographic study it will be supported the thesis that it is possible to improve Legal Science from the discoveries of Neuroscience, opening up a whole field of investigation called Neurolaw. Finally, some comments will be made as to how the Neurolaw allows the increase of the level of complexity with which Legal Science is able to deal, leaving behind old beliefs previously unquestioned. © 2018 Centro Universitario de Brasilia.

    "Abstract": "Over the last decades, deep brain stimulation has become an established treatment for movement disorder. However, the recent clinical research investigating the application of the technique for neuropsychiatric disorders as well as the potential to use DBS in a wider range of conditions has brought ethical controversy. This chapter examines some of the ethical objections against extending the use of DBS beyond the treatment of movement disorders. The first part of this chapter focuses on the objections related to the past uses of psychosurgery and examines the ethical weight of invasiveness and reversibility, two commonly used concepts in ethical discussions about DBS. The second part examines objections related to freedom and autonomy, including the slippery slope arguments related to “mind control,” as well as the issue of control over the parameters of the stimulation in the context of cognitive liberty. The third part briefly discusses the objection to the enhancement uses of DBS, highlighting different contexts in which DBS can be used for enhancement while arguing for a systematic consideration of ethically relevant factors instead of the reliance on the treatment/enhancement distinction. The final part addresses the objection to DBS related to threats to identity. First, the ethical weight of discontinuity under psychological continuity approaches to identity is discussed. Next, the focus turns to the narrative approach to identity and Schechtman’s objection to the use of DBS, and it is argued that although the narrative approach brings valuable insights, the normative conclusions we can draw from it are limited.  © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",

    "Abstract": "Remembering a past event elicits distributed neural patterns that can be distinguished from patterns elicited when encountering novel information. These differing patterns can be decoded with relatively high diagnostic accuracy for individual memories using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data. Brain-based memory detection—if valid and reliable—would have clear utility beyond the domain of cognitive neuroscience, in the realm of law, marketing, and beyond. However, a significant boundary condition on memory decoding validity may be the deployment of “countermeasures”: strategies used to mask memory signals. Here we tested the vulnerability of fMRI-based memory detection to countermeasures, using a paradigm that bears resemblance to eyewitness identification. Participants were scanned while performing two tasks on previously studied and novel faces: (1) a standard recognition memory task; and (2) a task wherein they attempted to conceal their true memory state. Univariate analyses revealed that participants were able to strategically modulate neural responses, averaged across trials, in regions implicated in memory retrieval, including the hippocampus and angular gyrus. Moreover, regions associated with goal-directed shifts of attention and thought substitution supported memory concealment, and those associated with memory generation supported novelty concealment. Critically, whereas MVPA enabled reliable classification of memory states when participants reported memory truthfully, the ability to decode memory on individual trials was compromised, even reversing, during attempts to conceal memory. Together, these findings demonstrate that strategic goal states can be deployed to mask memory-related neural patterns and foil memory decoding technology, placing a significant boundary condition on their real-world utility. © 2015 the authors.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: This paper sets out to examine the way in which neuroscientific knowledge and techniques have been used in some European courts, in order to assess their impact on the assessment of criminal responsibility and to anticipate potential misuse of neuroscience in the courts. Method: We conducted a case-law search and examined two European cases in which neuroscientific techniques were used in order to prove the diminished responsibility or irresponsibility of the accused. Results: After reviewing these cases we concluded that there were significant difficulties and limitations of technical/scientific, conceptual and legal nature, concerning the use of neuroscience for the assessment of responsibility. Discussion: Neuroscientific data, no matter how accurate and reliable may become, will only make sense in the quest for the assessment of criminal responsibility if they are contextualized and supplemented with data collected from other levels of analysis. Conclusion: Despite the importance of the contribution of neuroscience to forensic assessments for a more refined understanding of the complex interaction between the brain, mental states and behavior, the use of neuroscientific evidence in legal contexts will not dispense with the need to define the limits of responsibility and irresponsibility of the accused. It is a social, moral, political and, ultimately, legal question. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.",

    "Abstract": "Italy is in the forefront of forensic neuroscience practice among European nations. In recent years, the country presented two major criminal cases, the Trieste Case in 2009 and the Como Case in 2011, which were the first cases employing neurogenetic and functional neuroimaging methods in European courts. In these paper we will discuss the consequences that an understanding of the neural and genetic determinants of human (mis)behavior will have on law, especially on the Italian legal context. Some claim that such consequences will actually be revolutionary, while others argue that legal doctrine assumptions won’t be undermined by neuroscientific findings. In the first section of the paper, we introduce the general debate and follow with a section devoted to the two Italian cases. In the third and final section, we discuss epistemological and ethical issues regarding Italian neurolaw. We defend a position which diverges from those prevailing in the debate. While negative outcomes and concerns were usually evidenced, we focus on positive changes coming with the new paradigm of interaction between neuroscience and the law. Our view is that these cases are clearly pioneering ones, anticipating what will happen in the courtrooms of the European Union in the whole, in the near future. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

    "Abstract": "The humanistic perspective posits that activities and interventions that enhance an individual's sense of meaning and engagement constitute an important aspect of aging healthfully. This chapter describes the studies of artistic engagement for older persons often demonstrate enhanced quality of life, social engagement, physical and mental health, and sense of self. Participatory visual art therapy has been successful with cognitively impaired older adults. Compared to other art forms, film is only occasionally applied in the therapeutic setting and rarely with older adults. Shifting ideas of what defines \"normal\" versus \"abnormal\" aging have given rise to questions concerning neuroculture and its relationship to the individual lived experience of aging. The application of neuroimaging technologies to humanistic fields of study has resulted in new interdisciplinary subfields including neuropolitics, neurolaw, neuroethics, and neuroliterature. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "Ethicists have for the past 20 years debated the possibility of using neurointerventions to improve intelligence and even moral capacities, and thereby create a safer society. Contributing to a recent debate concerning neurointerventions in criminal rehabilitation, Nicole Vincent and Elizabeth Shaw have separately discussed the possibility of responsibility enhancement. In their ethical analyses, enhancing a convict’s capacity responsibility may be permissible. Both Vincent and Shaw consider self-control to be one of the constituent mental capacities of capacity responsibility. In this paper, we critically examine the promise of improving convicts’ capacity responsibility by neuroenhancements of self-control to see whether the special characteristics of the inmate population make a difference in the analyses. As improving self-control by means of neurointerventions seems plausible, we then ask whether it is or could be a justified measure in court rulings. We conclude that, even if there are cases in which neurointerventions were warranted in the context of the stated goals of the criminal court, i.e., decreasing recidivism and rehabilitating the offenders to the society, due to the range of individual variability in the constitution of self-control, the prescription of specific neurointerventions of self-control falls outside the scope of legitimate court rulings. © 2017, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Ongoing developments in neuroscientific techniques and technologies - such as neuroimaging - offer potential for greater insight into human behavior and have fostered temptation to use these approaches in legal contexts. Neuroscientists are increasingly called on to provide expert testimony, interpret brain images, and thereby inform judges and juries who are tasked with determining the guilt or innocence of an individual. In this essay, we draw attention to the actual capabilities and limitations of currently available assessment neurotechnologies and examine whether neuroscientific evidence presents unique challenges to existing frameworks of evidence law. In particular, we focus on (1) fundamental questions of relevance and admissibility that can and should be posed before the tests afforded in Daubert v. Merrill Dow Pharmaceuticals or Frye v. U.S. are applied and (2) how these considerations fit into the broader contexts of criminal law. We contend that neuroscientific evidence must first be scrutinized more heavily for its relevance, within Daubert and Federal Rule of Evidence 702, to ensure that the right questions are asked of neuroscientists, so as to enable expert interpretation of neuroscientific evidence within the limits of their knowledge and discipline that allows the judge or jury to determine the facts at issue in the case. We use the analogy provided by the Daubert court of an expert on the phases of the moon testifying to an individual's behavior on a particular night to ensure that we are, in fact, asking the neuroscientific expert the appropriate question. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",

    "Abstract": "This article intends to analyze the following research problem: are there objective mechanisms to identify the implementation of false memories that compromise testimony in criminal proceedings? As specific objectives, the article seeks to clarify the relationship between neuroscience and law, and the implications of this interaction for solving concrete problems in the legal sphere, considering that the collection of witness testimonies consists of one of the most used means of proof in the Brazilian criminal proceedings. As a complementary element, an analysis of the judgment of the case of the School of Early Childhood Education Base, in São Paulo, will be carried out as a paradigmatic example of the presence of false memories as a defining element of the judicial decision. The study have a qualitative approach, with support in literature review and descriptive analysis of the phenomena researched, in addition to supporting the quantitative analysis, based on information based on numerical standards and made available by the Superior Court of Justice, during the period between 2012 and 2018. The contribution is original and unpublished. It is concluded that there is a serious gap regarding the definition of objective elements for the identification of false memories and their discernment in relation to the crime of false witness. However, it is necessary to face the fact that the recognition of the suggested behavior requires deepening and interdisciplinarity, and that identification on the incidence of false memories can avoid enormous damages to the criminal procedural law. © 2018 Centro Universitario de Brasilia.

    "Abstract": "Background: Privacy is a unique privilege for humans. Enhancing the balance between the importance given to patient privacy and the receipt of this privacy by patients is one key approach to improving the relationship between patients and the hospital. Purpose: This study compared the difference between the importance of patient privacy and receipt of this privacy by patients as a reference for future patient privacy policy planning. Method: This study was a cross-sectional design. We randomly sampled three hospitals in northern Taiwan and investigated patients using a questionnaire. The questionnaire was self-designed and verified for reliability and validity. We used frequency and percentage to describe demographic data and used a t-test to compare the deviation between the emphasis on and receipt of patient privacy. Results: There were 296 valid samples in this study and the effective rate was 84.57%. The highest degree of importance was information privacy and the lowest was physical privacy. Physical privacy (t = 3.04, p < .001) and mental privacy (t = 2.42, p < .01) exhibited significant differences between emphasis and receipt. Demographic data on gender, age, education level, marital status, and occupation. Type of hospital and ward level correlated with the emphasis and receipt of privacy. Conclusion: The importance of privacy for physical and mental wellbeing was higher than the actual receipt of this privacy among the patient sample. The importance of privacy for married individuals and young women with high education levels was higher, while males and less-educated individuals scored lower in terms of privacy receipt. Medical agencies must provide higher levels of physical and mental privacy in order to enhance patient satisfaction.",

    "Abstract": "This short article proposes a conceptual structure for \"neurolaw,\" modeled loosely on the bipartite division of the sister field of neuroethics by Adina Roskies into the \"ethics of neuroscience\" and the \"neuroscience of ethics.\" As normative fields addressing the implications of scientific discoveries and expanding technological capacities affecting the brain, \"neurolaw\" and neuroethics have followed parallel paths. Similar foundational questions arise for both about the validity and utility of recognizing them as distinct subfields of law and ethics, respectively. In both, a useful distinction can be drawn between a self-reflexive inquiry (the neuroscience of ethics and law) and an inquiry into the development and use of brain science and technologies (the ethics and law of neuroscience). In both fields, these two forms of inquiry interact in interesting ways. In addition to a proposed conceptual structure for neurolaw, the article also addresses the neurolegal versions of the critiques made against neuroethics, including charges of reductionism, fact/value confusion, and biological essentialism.",

    "Abstract": "In this chapter, the authors analyse the issues connected to emerging neurotechnologies, in particular their effects on (legal) concepts like capacity, liability, testimony, and evidence, and also on fundamental constitutional rights and freedoms like the right to autonomy and the right not to be treated without consent (in the general framework of the principle of human dignity). Starting from preliminary remarks on the key concepts of neuroethics/technoethics, neurolaw/technolaw, the authors investigate how personal liability is changing in the framework of new scientific developments. The chapter underlines that neurolaw challenges some of the traditional legal institutions in the field of law (e.g., criminal law). From the point of view of ethics, the chapter concludes that neuroethics is not challenged by the data coming from the use of emerging neurotechnologies, but human self-perception is strongly affected by it. © 2014 by IGI Global.

    "Abstract": "Definition of the problem: Fifteen years after establishing neuroethics as an international academic field, neuroethics has emerged as a vibrant, dynamic area of scientific research. Arguments: Within a short period of a few years, specific conferences, journals, research funding programs, professional societies, and institutes were founded. Nonetheless, considerable disagreement about its definition and subject matter still remain. We argue for a differentiated conceptualization according to which the deliberate reflection of ethical problems arising from the neurosciences and their predominantly neurotechnological application belongs as much to neuroethics as does the ethical reflection of the neuroscience of morality. This does not comprise neuroscientific or neuropsychological research on morality itself, but includes the contemplation of the significance of such research for ethics and the law. Here, we provide an overview about the most important topics in neuroethics and elucidate the relevance of neuroethics for a vast diversity of societal domains reaching well beyond medicine and health care. Conclusion: The great potential of neuroethics as a novel branch of academic research lies in finding new answers to pressing questions of high societal relevance by linking neurophilosophy and bioethics topics as well as its broad interdisciplinary network. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",

    "Abstract": "Advancements in neuroscience cast new light on the functioning of the human mind. This is especially important within the context of criminal law, wherein consciousness plays a crucial role in determining criminal responsibility. Yet, there are some caveats in the direct application of these new findings, most of which are related to the specific con-ceptual framework of law based upon commonsense knowledge and (sometimes) outdated psychology. This framework has also produced different doctrines of interpre-tation in the systems of common and civil law. Moreover, the goals of the law are to some extent different from scien-tific research on the brain. The aim of this study is to assess to what extent and under what interpretation scientific knowledge concerning consciousness might be useful for legal purposes, especially for the criminal law. Our assess-ment is that most of the current concepts of criminal law are directly related to outdated psychological and neuroscien-tific theories, and that the content of those concepts should be updated according to the newest scientific findings while remaining in accordance with the primary functions of crim-inal law. © 2018 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.",

    "Abstract": "Neuromarketing utilizes modern techniques of monitoring brain functioning in order to design efficient advertising contents. Due to its capacity to interfere with and to influence decision process of customers, neuromarketing is regarded as highly controversial. The article examines possible manners of protection of individuals from the perspective of personal autonomy and privacy protection. It analyzes possibilities of challenging validity of legal transactions made under influence of neuromarketing based advertising as well as applicability of unfair practices in advertising. The paper also claims that the current personal data protection legislation is not applicable. Privacy of mind is described in terms of privacy of contents and privacy of processes. Mental processes are considered as crucial for creating contents of mind as well as for an individual approach to own privacy. The article concludes that the current regulation of unfair practices as well as the regulation of privacy do not provide an appropriate level of protection and that general clauses should be complemented with specific provision on inadmissible practices in advertising. © 2017, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Institute of State and Law.

    "Abstract": "Rapid advancements in human neuroscience and neurotechnology open unprecedented possibilities for accessing, collecting, sharing and manipulating information from the human brain. Such applications raise important challenges to human rights principles that need to be addressed to prevent unintended consequences. This paper assesses the implications of emerging neurotechnology applications in the context of the human rights framework and suggests that existing human rights may not be sufficient to respond to these emerging issues. After analysing the relationship between neuroscience and human rights, we identify four new rights that may become of great relevance in the coming decades: the right to cognitive liberty, the right to mental privacy, the right to mental integrity, and the right to psychological continuity. © 2017, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The paper aims to revisit the origin of the disciplinary gap that occurs between Natural Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities, by revisiting classic literature in English language tradition throughout the XX century (in particular, the provocative lecture by Percy Snow and, in the same tradition, the subsequent Wilson/Lewontin controversy). This departure led to the current model of hyper-specialization which, although it has promoted a remarkable advance in each one of the disciplines, had as a consequence the fragmentation of the own knowledge and the loss of the coherence between each one of these parts. This model shows signs of exhaustion, since it is not able to face fundamental philosophical questions, nor to present satisfactory solutions to the great human problems of contemporaries. In this context, we present Consilience, which proposes the recovery of coherence between all branches of knowledge, both in the task of knowing our own humanity and in the task of presenting answers to these great problems. As a conclusion, it has been realized that, for the Law, this movement of approximation can have disruptive consequences, since the explanations of the Cognitive Sciences for the human behavior can defy fundamental notions with which the Law operates. To equate all this is the task that is attributed to the Neuro-Right. The originality of the article lies in the recovery of the origins for the disciplinary removal, and the reasons for its overcoming, always within the context of the Law. This revision brought light to the task of making all this knowledge coherent, or consilient. Within Legal Sciences, this is the task belongs to Neurolaw. © 2018 Centro Universitario de Brasilia.

    "Abstract": "Professionals involved in the criminal justice system routinely make decisions about the culpability of offenders. The behavior of punishing an offender has been studied by psychologists and neuroscientists, who seek to understand the motivations underlying the act of punishing, as well as which brain structures are involved in processing information about the intentionality and severity of an offense. Recent studies indicate that the decision to punish involves specific brain areas related to the function, in the context of evolution of the species, to stabilize cooperation in groups, through the reinforcement of social norms due to the application of sanctions. In this article, we seek to make a critical review of this literature, pointing out that, despite the importance of the studies of the so-called Neuroscience of Punishment, its assumptions are still debatable from the point of view both of Evolutionary Biology and Cognitive Neuroscience. © 2018 Centro Universitario de Brasilia.

    "Abstract": "Currently, many scientific fields such as psychology or biomedicine face a methodological crisis concerning the reproducibility, replicability, and validity of their research. In neuroimaging, similar methodological concerns have taken hold of the field, and researchers are working frantically toward finding solutions for the methodological problems specific to neuroimaging. This article examines some ethical and legal implications of this methodological crisis in neuroimaging. With respect to ethical challenges, the article discusses the impact of flawed methods in neuroimaging research in cognitive and clinical neuroscience, particularly with respect to faulty brain-based models of human cognition, behavior, and personality. Specifically examined is whether such faulty models, when they are applied to neurological or psychiatric diseases, could put patients at risk, and whether this places special obligations on researchers using neuroimaging. In the legal domain, the actual use of neuroimaging as evidence in United States courtrooms is surveyed, followed by an examination of ways that the methodological problems may create challenges for the criminal justice system. Finally, the article reviews and promotes some promising ideas and initiatives from within the neuroimaging community for addressing the methodological problems.

    "Abstract": "In this chapter, the author outlines some of the issues that, from an exclusively subjective point of view, seem to be more relevant in the field of public law. The possible consequences \"neurolaw\" might have on a branch of law like this cannot be overlooked, because this branch is anyway decisive, not only for the fate of an individual, but also for the destiny of the human population in general at the local, national and global level. The scope of this chapter is to attract the reader's attention on the assumptions at the basis of the changes that are presently taking place in the juridical tradition of the western world using neurolaw that can play a useful part in all these changes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland and G.

    "Abstract": "Existentialism is a concern about the foundation of meaning, morals, and purpose. Existentialisms arise when some foundation for these elements of being is under assault. In the past, first-wave existentialism concerned the increasingly apparent inability of religion and religious tradition to provide such a foundation, as typified in the writings of Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche. Second-wave existentialism, personified philosophically by Sartre, Camus, and de Beauvoir, developed in response to the inability of an overly optimistic Enlightenment vision of reason and the common good to provide such a foundation. There is a third-wave existentialism, a new existentialism, developing in response to advances in the neurosciences that threaten the last vestiges of an immaterial soul or self. With the increasing explanatory and therapeutic power of neuroscience, the mind no longer stands apart from the world to serve as a foundation of meaning. This produces foundational anxiety. This collection of new essays explores the anxiety caused by this third-wave existentialism and some responses to it. It brings together some of the world℉s leading philosophers, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, and legal scholars to tackle our neuroexistentialist predicament and explore what the mind sciences can tell us about morality, love, emotion, autonomy, consciousness, selfhood, free will, moral responsibility, law, the nature of criminal punishment, meaning in life, and purpose. © Oxford University Press 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Since the 1990s, a growing number of social science researchers collaborate in the creation of areas of research such as neurolaw, neuroeducation, neuroeconomy or neuromarketing. Sometimes referred to as ‘neurodisciplines’, these areas of research share a common postulate: the measure and analysis of the nervous system’s activity offers the possibility of discovering new ways of explaining human behaviour. Neuromarketing first appeared in the early 2000s and has developped in both university laboratories and private ones. Neuromarketers aim to understand consumer behaviour by applying neuroscientific theories and methods of measuring neurobiological activity to marketing questions. As a controversial topic, neuromarketing is critized in both the public space and academia. Some members of the media, some consumer associations and some neuromarketers see neuromarketing as having a more or less realistic power of persuasion (Lindstrom, 2009) while most neuroscientists qualify it as a scam or publicity stunt (Nature, 2004). Starting from bibliometric analysis of neuromarketing publications, we define the shifting boundaries of this area of research whose subject itself is still opened to debate. Building on Pierre Bourdieu’s work on the scientific field, we highlight the forces that shape this speciality both in and out of the academic field. Based on semidirective interviews, we demonstrate that neuromarketers have to develop discursive strategies to distance themselves from the controversial image of neuromarketing and adopt publication strategies in order to disseminate the results of their research in the scientific field. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",

    "Abstract": "As scientific understanding of behavioural genetics and brain physiology have increased, so too have attempts to utilise this information in criminal cases. Defendants in a growing number of jurisdictions have sought the influence of such factors upon a favourable outcome for their trials or a reduction in the subsequent sentence received. This chapter reviews some of the most prominent international cases in which attempts have been made to introduce genetic or brain imaging evidence into criminal proceedings. The majority have taken place in the USA, which seems to have been quicker to allow consideration of this kind of evidence within the legal system. A willingness to reflect on the merits of evidence of this kind does not necessarily translate into a willingness to let it influence the decisions made. To date, there remain relatively few examples where neuroscientific evidence has had a significant impact on the outcome of the case, but there have been some, and their number is growing. © 2016, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Health-related psychedelic research should focus on helping us flourish, not just remedying ill-health or addiction. We don’t know enough about how psychedelics could enhance human flourishing. Factors promoting health-through-flourishing include finding meaning in life, spiritual practices, comfortable levels of social bonds, emotionally/physically satisfying sex in a long-term monogamous relationship and control over one’s daily life. Psychedelic research could find more. Neuroscience anchors psychedelic research into disease and disorder, e.g. addiction, PSTD, migraine, anxiety, pain etc. Neurophenomenological psychedelics research could illuminate relationships between health, ASC/NOSCs and cognitive liberty to promote human flourishing. If we accept the self as an epiphenomenon of subsystems within the brain, we ‘know’ ‘unconsciously’, but are not aware of, many things which affect our lives profoundly. These include control over identifying, remembering and forgetting our states of mind and how to move between them. A prerequisite for integrated investigations into ASC/NOSCs is the establishment of a taxonomic knowledge base which lists, categorises and characterises ASC/NOSCs to enable us to choose specific states of mind and move securely among them. Or, in other words, to enable us to exercise our cognitive liberty safely. I believe that human health and flourishing would be enhanced were we able to direct our states of being by consciously choosing them. Given the promise of mindfulness techniques to enhance our health, happiness and spiritual growth, constructing both personal and generic classifications of salient ASC/NOSCs makes sense. Laws need to change. The neuroscience of pleasure, love, spirituality, decision-making, pattern recognition and location of meaning should inform health-enhancing psychedelic research while promoting flourishing through cognitive liberty. As part of cognitive liberty, our end-of-life choices should include how we die. In other words, our idea of the good death should include access to psychedelics. Dying high is increasingly likely to become a popular choice as baby boomers age and place their economic clout behind the reform of end-of-life laws as well as drug laws. Achieving such crucial legal changes depends partly on the ability to produce research to anchor evidence based law and policy. Research into psychedelics, ASC/NOSCs and the neurobiology of the dying process is essential. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.",

    "Abstract": "Neuroscientific evidence is increasingly being used in criminal trials as part of psychiatric testimony. Up to now, \"neurolaw\" literature remained focused on the use of neuroscience for assessments of criminal responsibility. However, in the field of forensic psychiatry, responsibility assessments are progressively being weakened, whereas dangerousness and risk assessment gain increasing importance. In this paper, we argue that the introduction of neuroscientific data by forensic experts in criminal trials will be mostly be used in the future as a means to evaluate or as an indication of an offender's dangerousness, rather than their responsibility. Judges confronted with the pressure to ensure public security may tend to interpret neuroscientific knowledge and data as an objective and reliable way of evaluating one's risk of reoffending. First, we aim to show how the current socio-legal context has reshaped the task of the forensic psychiatrist, with dangerousness assessments prevailing. In the second part, we examine from a critical point of view the promise of neuroscience to serve a better criminal justice system by offering new tools for risk assessment. Then we aim to explain why neuroscientific evidence is likely to be used as evidence of dangerousness of the defendants. On a theoretical level, the current tendency in criminal policies to focus on prognostics of dangerousness seems to be \"justified\" by a utilitarian approach to punishment, supposedly revealed by new neuroscientific discoveries that challenge the notions of free will and responsibility. Although often promoted as progressive and humane, we believe that this approach could lead to an instrumentalization of neuroscience in the interest of public safety and give rise to interventions which could entail ethical caveats and run counter to the interests of the offenders. The last part of this paper deals with some of these issues-the danger of stigmatization for brain damaged offenders because of adopting a purely therapeutic approach to crime, and the impact on their sentencing, in particular. © 2016.",

    "Abstract": "Summary Aim In the past few years, spectacular progress in neuroscience has led to the emergence of a new interdisciplinary field, the so-called \"neurolaw\" whose goal is to explore the effects of neuroscientific discoveries on legal proceedings and legal rules and standards. In the United States, a number of neuroscientific researches are designed specifically to explore legally relevant topics and a case-law has already been developed. In Europe, neuroscientific evidence is increasingly being used in criminal courtrooms, as part of psychiatric testimony, nourishing the debate about the legal implications of brain research in psychiatric-legal settings. Though largely debated, up to now the use of neuroscience in legal contexts had not specifically been regulated by any legislation. In 2011, with the new bioethics law, France has become the first country to admit by law the use of brain imaging in judicial expertise. According to the new law, brain imaging techniques can be used only for medical purposes, or scientific research, or in the context of judicial expertise. This study aims to give an overview of the current state of the neurolaw in the US and Europe, and to investigate the ethical issues raised by this new law and its potential impact on the rights and civil liberties of the offenders. Method An overview of the emergence and development of \"neurolaw\" in the United States and Europe is given. Then, the new French law is examined in the light of the relevant debates in the French parliament. Consequently, we outline the current tendencies in Neurolaw literature to focus on assessments of responsibility, rather than dangerousness. This tendency is analysed notably in relation to the legal context relevant to criminal policies in France, where recent changes in the legislation and practice of forensic psychiatry show that dangerousness assessments have become paramount in the process of judicial decision. Finally, the potential interpretations of neuroscientific data introduced into psychiatric testimonies by judges are explored. Results The examination of parliamentary debates showed that the new French law allowing neuroimaging techniques in judicial expertise was introduced in the aim to provide a legal framework that would protect the subject against potential misuses of neuroscience. The underlying fear above all, was that this technology be used as a lie detector, or as a means to predict the subject's behaviour. However, the possibility of such misuse remains open. Contrary to the legislator's wish, the defendant is not fully guaranteed against uses of neuroimaging techniques in criminal courts that would go against their interests and rights. In fact, the examination of the recently adopted legislation in France shows that assessments of dangerousness and of risk of recidivism have become central elements of the criminal policy, which makes it possible, if not likely that neuroimaging techniques be used for the evaluation of the dangerousness of the defendant. This could entail risks for the latter, as judges could perceive neuroscientific data as hard evidence, more scientific and reliable than the soft data of traditional psychiatry. If such neuroscientific data are interpreted as signs of potential dangerousness of a subject rather than as signs of criminal responsibility, defendants may become subjected to longer penalties or measures aiming to ensure public safety in the detriment of their freedom. Conclusion In the current context of accentuated societal need for security, the judge and the expert-psychiatrist are increasingly asked to evaluate the dangerousness of a subject, regardless of their responsibility. Influenced by this policy model, the judge might tend to use neuroscientific data introduced by an expert as signs of dangerousness. Such uses, especially when they subjugate an individual's interest to those of society, might entail serious threats to an individual's freedom and civil liberties. © 2014 L'Encéphale, Paris.",

    "Abstract": "In this contribution an empirical approach is used to gain more insight into the relationship between neuroscience and criminal law. The focus is on case law in the Netherlands. Neuroscientific information and techniques have found their way into the courts of the Netherlands. Furthermore, following an Italian case in which a mentally ill offender received a penalty reduction in part because of a 'genetic vulnerability for impulsive aggression', the expectation was expressed that such 'genetic defenses' would appear in the Netherlands too. To assess how neuroscientific and behavioral genetic information are used in criminal justice practice in the Netherlands, we systematically collect Dutch criminal cases in which neuroscientific or behavioral genetic information is introduced. Data and case law examples are presented and discussed. Although cases are diverse, several themes appear, such as prefrontal brain damage in relation to criminal responsibility and recidivism risk, and divergent views of the implications of neurobiological knowledge about addiction for judging criminal responsibility. Whereas in the international 'neurolaw literature' the emphasis is often on imaging techniques, the Dutch findings also illustrate the role of neuropsychological methods in criminal cases. Finally, there appears to be a clear need of practice oriented instruments and guidelines. © The Author 2015.",

    "Abstract": "The implications of neuroscience in the legal context have been considered in many countries; however, there has been very little (if any) research on the use of neuroscience in criminal law in Iran. Furthermore, because Iran's legal system incorporates Islamic rules, the legal implications of neuroscience might be fundamentally different from those of other countries. Accordingly, this paper will discuss the potential use of neuroscientific evidence in the evaluation of criminal responsibility and the assessment of sentencing within the Islamic legal system of Iran. The study will conclude that while there are a number of issues that may prevent the use of neuroscience in Iran's criminal justice system, there is a potential for the neuroscience to be used for purposes such as establishing the insanity defense and mitigating the punishment. © The Author(s) 2018.",

    "Abstract": "Neuropolitics is the intersection of neuroscience and political science, and it has the interdisciplinary goal of transforming both disciplines. This article reviews the past 20 years of work in the field, identifying its roots, some overarching themes-reactions to political attitudinal questions and candidates faces, identification of political ideology based on brain structure or reactivity to nonpolitical stimuli, and racial attitudes- A nd obstacles to its progress. I then explore the methodological and analytical advances that point the way forward for the future of neuropolitics. Although the field has been slow to develop compared with neurolaw and neuroeconomics, innovations look ripe for dramatically improving our ability to model political behaviors and attitudes in individuals and predict political choices in mass publics. The coming advancements, however, pose risks to our current norms of democratic deliberation, and academics need to anticipate and mitigate these risks. © 2017 Association for Politics and the Life Sciences.",

    "Abstract": "This chapter argues that the folk-psychological model of the person and responsibility is not challenged by determinism in general or by neurodeterminism in particular. Until science conclusively demonstrates that human beings cannot be guided by reasons and that mental states play no role in explaining behavior, the folk-psychological model of responsibility is justified. This chapter discusses the motivations to turn to science to solve the hard normative problems the law addresses, as well as the law’s psychology and its concepts of the person and responsibility. Then it considers the general relation of neuroscience to law, which I characterize as the issue of “translation.” The limits of neurolaw are canvassed and the chapter argues that neurolaw poses no radical challenge to the concepts of the person and responsibility. The chapter is cautiously optimistic about the contribution that neuroscience may make to law in the near and intermediate term. The penultimate section examines some of the claims concerning responsibility made in other chapters in this volume followed by a brief conclusion. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",

    "Abstract": "Neurolaw is the emerging research field and practice of applying neuroscientific knowledge to legal standards and proceedings. This intersection of neuroscience and law has put up some serious claims, the most significant of which is the overall transformation of the legal system as we know it. The claim has met with strong opposition from scholars of law, such as Michael Pardo and Dennis Patterson (2011), who argue that neurolaw (and neuroscience more generally) is conceptually wrong and thus perceive most of it as \"nonsense\" (Patterson, 2003). I expose a flaw in Pardo and Patterson's arguments by means of confirmation theory. My main point is that Pardo and Patterson use implicit hypothetico-deductivism in their attack on neurolaw, and that we have good reasons to doubt the employment of such a model, because it faces serious theoretical problems. I then demonstrate how the alleged problems associated with neurolaw disappear if we use a quantitative probabilistic account of confirmation. I also explain why it provides a better account for the way the legal system actually works. © 2018 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.",

    "Abstract": "In Minds, Brains, and Law, Michael Pardo and Dennis Patterson argue that current attempts to use neuroscience to inform the theory and practice of law founder because they are built on confused conceptual foundations. Proponents of neurolaw attribute to the brain or to its parts psychological properties that belong only to people; this mistake vitiates many of the claims they make. Once neurolaw is placed on a sounder conceptual footing, Pardo and Patterson claim, we will see that its more dramatic claims are false or meaningless, though it might be able to provide inductive evidence for particular less dramatic claims (that a defendant may be lying, or lacks control over their behavior, for instance). In response, I argue that the central conceptual confusions identified by Pardo and Patterson are not confusions at all. Though some of the claims made by its proponents are hasty and sometimes they are confused, there are no conceptual barriers to attributing psychological properties to brain states. Neuroscience can play a role in producing evidence that is more reliable than subjective report or behavior; it therefore holds out the possibility of dramatically altering our self-conception as agents and thereby the law. © 2014 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Advances in neuroscience are beginning to shape law and public policy, giving rise to the field of “neurolaw.” The impact of neuroscientific evidence on how laws are written and interpreted in practice will depend in part on how neurolaw is understood by the public. Drawing on a nationally representative telephone survey experiment, this article presents the first evidence on public approval of neurolaw. We find that the public is generally neutral in its support for neuroscience-based legal reforms. However, how neurolaw is framed affects support based on partisanship: Republicans’ approval of neurolaw decreases when neuroscience is seen as primarily serving to reduce offender culpability, whereas Democrats’ approval is unaffected by how neurolaw is framed. These results suggest that both framing and partisanship may shape the future of neuroscience-based reforms in law and policy. © 2015 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.",

    "Abstract": "Important advances in neuroscience and neuroimaging have revolutionized our understanding of the human brain. Many of these advances provide new evidence regarding compensable injuries that have been used to support changes in legal policy. For example, we now know that regions of the brain involved in decision making continue to develop into the mid-20s, and this information weighs heavily in determining that execution or automatic sentence of life without the possibility of parole for someone younger than 18 years old, at the time of the crime, violates the 8th Amendment prohibition against “cruel and unusual punishment.” The probative value of other testimony regarding neuroimaging, however, is less clear, particularly for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also known as concussion. There is nonetheless some evidence that new imaging technologies, most notably diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), may be useful in detecting mTBI. More specifically, DTI is sensitive to detecting diffuse axonal brain injuries in white matter, the most common brain injury in mTBI. DTI is, in fact, the most promising technique available today for such injuries and it is beginning to be used clinically, although it remains largely within the purview of research. Its probative value is also not clear as it may be both prejudicial and misleading given that standardization is not yet established for use in either the clinic or the courtroom, and thus it may be premature for use in either. There are also concerns with the methods and analyses that have been used to provide quantitative evidence in legal cases. It is within this context that we provide a commentary on the use of neuroimaging in the courtroom, most particularly DTI, and the admissibility of evidence, as well as the definition and role of expert testimony. While there is a great deal of evidence demonstrating cognitive impairments in attention, processing speed, memory, and concentration from neuropsychological testing following mTBI, we focus here on the more recent introduction of DTI imaging in the courtroom. We also review definitions of mTBI followed by admissibility standards for scientific evidence in the courtroom, including Daubert criteria and two subsequent cases that comprise the so-called Daubert trilogy rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony. This is followed by a brief review of neuroimaging techniques available today, the latter with an emphasis on DTI and its application to mTBI. We then review some of the court rulings on the use of DTI. We end by highlighting the importance of neuroimaging in providing a new window on the brain, while cautioning against the premature use of new advances in imaging in the courtroom before standards are established in the clinical arena, which are informed by research. We also discuss further what is needed to reach a tipping point where such advances will provide important and meaningful data with respect to their probative value. © 2018",

    "Abstract": "Causality (or causation) is central to every legal case, yet its underlying philosophical, legal, and psychological definitions and conceptions vary. In the criminal context, it refers to establishing the responsibility of the perpetrator of the criminal act at issue in terms of the person's mental state (mens rea), and whether the insanity defense applies. In the forensic disability and related context, it refers to whether the index event is a material or contributing cause in the multifactorial array that led to the psychological condition at issue. In both the criminal and tort contexts, the legal test is a counterfactual one. For the former, it refers to whether the outcome involved would have resulted absent the act (e.g., in cases of simultaneous criminal lethal action, which one is the but-for responsible one). For the latter, it concerns whether the claimed psychological condition would be present only because of the incident at issue. The latter event at issue is distinguished from the criminal one by its negligence compared to the voluntary intent in the criminal case. The psychological state of the perpetrator of criminal conduct can be analyzed from a biopsychosocial perspective as much as the civil one. In this regard, in the civil case, such as in forensic disability and related assessments, pre-existing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors need to be considered causally, with personal and social resilience and protective factors added, as well. In the criminal context, the same biopsychosocial model applies, but with mental competence and voluntariness added as a critical factor. The advent of neurolaw has led to use of neuroscience in court, but it risks reducing the complexity of criminal cases to unifactorial, biological models. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "This paper reimagines drug policy - specifically psychedelic drug policy - through the prism of human rights. Challenges to the incumbent prohibitionist paradigm that have been brought from this perspective to date - namely by calling for exemptions from criminalisation on therapeutic or religious grounds - are considered, before the assertion is made that there is a need to go beyond such reified constructs, calling for an end to psychedelic drug prohibitions on the basis of the more fundamental right to cognitive liberty. This central concept is explicated, asserted as being a crucial component of freedom of thought, as enshrined within Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). It is argued that the right to cognitive liberty is routinely breached by the existence of the system of drug prohibition in the United Kingdom (UK), as encoded within the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (MDA). On this basis, it is proposed that Article 9 could be wielded to challenge the prohibitive system in the courts. This legal argument is supported by a parallel and entwined argument grounded in the political philosophy of classical liberalism: namely, that the state should only deploy the criminal law where an individual's actions demonstrably run a high risk of causing harm to others.Beyond the courts, it is recommended that this liberal, rights-based approach also inform psychedelic drug policy activism, moving past the current predominant focus on harm reduction, towards a prioritization of benefit maximization. How this might translate in to a different regulatory model for psychedelic drugs, a third way, distinct from the traditional criminal and medical systems of control, is tentatively considered. However, given the dominant political climate in the UK - with its move away from rights and towards a more authoritarian drug policy - the possibility that it is only through underground movements that cognitive liberty will be assured in the foreseeable future is contemplated. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Philosophical compatibilism reconciles moral responsibility with determinism, and some neurolaw scholars think that it can also reconcile legal views about responsibility with scientific findings about the neurophysiological basis of human action. Although I too am a compatibilist, this paper argues that philosophical compatibilism cannot be transplanted “as-is” from philosophy into law. Rather, before compatibilism can be re-deployed, it must first be modified to take account of differences between legal and moral responsibility, and between a scientific and a deterministic world view, and to address a range of conceptual, normative, empirical and doctrinal problems that orbit its capacitarian core. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study investigated the relationships between psychopathy and impulsive and risky decision making, by utilizing intertemporal and probabilistic choices for both gain and loss, in addition to the Iowa gambling task. METHODS: The Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised - a 154-item measure that assesses psychopathic traits by self-report - was used with a 4-point response scale to assess 113 undergraduate students from three Japanese universities. Participants' performance on the Iowa Gambling Task and four behavioral neuroeconomic tasks of discounting - delayed gain, delayed loss, uncertain gain, and uncertain loss - were estimated. RESULTS: Risky decisions in probability discounting of gain and loss were associated with psychopathy. Psychopathic traits had no relationship with performance on the Iowa Gambling and were not significantly related to delay discounting. CONCLUSIONS: Psychopathy is predicted by risky decision in probability discounting of gain and loss, but not strongly associated with future myopia. Implications of the present findings for neuroeconomics and neurolaw are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "In the following article we first present the growing trend of incorporating neuroscience into the law, and the growing acceptance of and trust in neuroscience's mechanistic and reductionistic explanations of the human mind. We then present and discuss some studies that show how nudging peoples' beliefs about matters related to human agency (such as free will, decision-making, or self-control) towards a more deterministic, mechanistic and/or reductionistic conception, exerts an influence on their very actions, mentality, and brain processes. We suggest that the neuroscientific view of the human mind exerts an influence on the very cognitive phenomena neuroscience falsely believes to be studying objectively. This holds especially when we consider the systematic integration of neuroscience into the public domain, such as the law. For, such an integration acts as a reinforcement of the public's and legal decision-makers' endorsement of and trust in neuroscience's view of human nature that further changes how people think and act. Such looping effects of neurolaw are probably inevitable. Accordingly, we should be aware of the scope of neuroscientific explanations and be careful not to overstate neuroscientific evidence and findings in legal contexts. © 2018 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.",

    "Abstract": "Because numerous standards and ethics rules underscore the importance of language and communication within the legal process, the inability to successfully comprehend legal language is a pressing concern, particularly because many populations that are overrepresented within legal systems typically show problems with language and communication. In order to better describe the nexus between language comprehension and the law, therefore, I identify four hierarchical aspects of legal language and concepts that may challenge the language-comprehension processes and impede comprehension: (1) the challenge to “lower level” cognitive functions; (2) the demand for inferences; (3) the need for complex situation models; and (4) the idiosyncratic nature of legal language's text “genre.” Using common examples of black-letter law, I examine how these four aspects might create legal problems and ethical concerns for both the adjudicated individual and the representing attorney. This analysis should be a valuable first step in allowing the neurolaw and bioethics fields to better identify and research these important ethical dilemmas. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "The ability to survive within a cooperative society depends on impartial third-party punishment (TPP) of social norm violations. Two cognitive mechanisms have been postulated as necessary for the successful completion of TPP: Evaluation of legal responsibility and selection of a suitable punishment given the magnitude of the crime. Converging neuroimaging research suggests two supporting domain-general networks; a mentalizing network for evaluation of legal responsibility and a central-executive network for determination of punishment. A whole-brain voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach was used in conjunction with a rank-order TPP task to identify brain regions necessary for TPP in a large sample of patients with penetrating traumatic brain injury. Patients who demonstrated atypical TPP had specific lesions in core regions of the mentalizing (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex [PFC], ventromedial PFC) and central-executive (bilateral dorsolateral PFC, right intraparietal sulcus) networks. Altruism and executive functioning (concept formation skills) were significant predictors of TPP: Altruism was uniquely associated with TPP in patients with lesions in right dorsolateral PFC and executive functioning was uniquely associated with TPP in individuals with lesions in left PFC. Our findings contribute to the extant literature to support underlying neural networks associated with TPP, with specific brain-behavior causal relationships confirming recent functional neuroimaging research. © The Author (2015).

    "Abstract": "One of the areas inwhich brain-based mind reading (BMR) may be applied is forensic psychiatry. The purpose of this paper is to identify opportunities and challenges for forensic psychiatry regarding BMR. In order to do so, a conceptual framework for BMRwill be introduced, which distinguishes between three basic types of BMR, based on how they relate to the subject's knowledge. In addition, three features of BMR techniques will be articulated: first, whether they require passive cooperation; second, whether they require active cooperation; and third, whether they require that the subject is awake. Each of the types of BMR entails specific chances and risks for forensic psychiatry, involving, for example, confidentiality in the doctor- patient relationship and the possibility of coercive use of BMR techniques. It will be concluded that apart from legal considerations, such as tests of admissibility of evidence, professional ethics is highly relevant. © The Author 2017.",

    "Abstract": "Caution is one of the orienting principles of neuroscience’s advance in different social spheres. This article shows the importance of maintaining caution in the area of neurolaw because of its risk of becoming a new power that is free from ethical discussion. The article’s objective is to note the principal ethical implications and limitations of neurolaw in light of six cases in which neuroscientific evidence was used in distinct ways. This study seeks to examine the precautions that should be taken in regard to the advance of neurolaw so as not to lose sight of its emancipatory interest.

    "Abstract": "The term '‘cognitive liberty’’ has been used in a variety of ways. In general, it refers to the degree to which an individual has the right to control his or her own mental and emotional brain processes against the desires of external agents, especially the state, to control or access them. It is largely reflective of the value of neuroprivacy, the idea that privacy rights extend to a citizen’s brain, and that if privacy has any meaning at all, it must mean one’s right to protect the contents of one’s brain (i.e., one’s thoughts, emotions, and other subjective states). These terms are relatively recent concepts, reactions to the development of neurotechnologies that are beginning to allow unprecedented access to the inner workings of the brain.

    "Abstract": "This chapter will examine the blurred boundaries between the sacred and the secular when it comes to psychedelic experiences, and the inevitable ensuing arbitrariness involved in protecting some such rituals and not others. It will put forth the argument that there is a need to move beyond simply seeking exemptions from drug prohibition in the name of religious freedom; rather, there should be a broader right to ingest psychedelics as an aspect of cognitive liberty. Cognitive liberty is the right to control one's own consciousness. It is a concept that equates to freedom of thought, a right protected internationally by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and enforceable in Europe through Article 9 of the European Convention of Human Rights. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

    "Abstract": "Neuroscientific imaging evidence (NIE) has become an integral part of the criminal justice system in the United States. However, in most legal cases, NIE is submitted and used only to mitigate penalties because the court does not recognize it as substantial evidence, considering its lack of reliability. Nevertheless, we here discuss how neuroscience is expected to improve the use of NIE in the legal system. For this purpose,we classified the efforts of neuroscientists into three research strategies: cognitive subtraction, the data-driven approach, and the brain-manipulation approach. Cognitive subtraction is outdated and problematic; consequently, the court deemed it to be an inadequate approach in terms of legal evidence in 2012. In contrast, the data-driven and brain manipulation approaches, which are state-of-the-art approaches, have overcome the limitations of cognitive subtraction. The data-driven approach brings data science into the field and is benefiting immensely from the development of research platforms that allow automatized collection, analysis,and sharing of data. This broadens the scale of imaging evidence. The brain-manipulation approach uses high-functioning tools that facilitate non-invasive and precise human brain manipulation. These two approaches are expected to have synergistic effects. Neuroscience has strived to improve the evidential reliability of NIE, with considerable success. With the support of cutting-edge technologies, and the progress of these approaches, the evidential status of NIE will be improved and NIE will become an increasingly important part of legal practice. © 2018 Jun and Yoo.",

    "Abstract": "This ambitious book aims to make a substantive contribution to six separate debates within neuroethics — the existence of free will, the impact of cognitive enhancement and (separately) of memory management on personal identity, the nature of mental privacy, the supposed subjectivity of pain, and the proper definition of death — all in the context of a framing argument concerning the relation between common sense psychological concepts and scientific concepts. Gligorov means to rebut skepticism about folk mental states in the face of surprising neuroscientific results by reconceptualizing folk theories as protean, incorporating some of the very results that seem to challenge them. My impression is that Gligorov’s arguments on cognitive enhancement, memory modification, and brain death make helpful contributions to the respective literatures on those subjects, but I close with a number of concerns about the book, especially whether its framing argument is successful in its current form. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

    "Abstract": "Currently, potential jurors' racial biases are measured by explicit questioning-a poor measure because people often hide their views to adhere to social norms, and people have implicit views they are not consciously aware of. In this experiment, we investigated whether two alternative methods of measuring racial bias-a standard Black/White, good/bad Implicit Association Test (IAT) and neural activity, measured by fMRI, in response to seeing faces of Black and White individuals-could predict how much money subjects would award Black victims in hypothetical employment discrimination cases. IAT scores failed to predict how much money subjects awarded victims. However, in right inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and in right superior/middle frontal gyrus (BA 9/10)-which have both previously been implicated in measuring biases and implicit preferences-the difference in neural activity between when subjects viewed Black faces paired with neutral adjectives and when subjects viewed White faces paired with neutral adjectives was positively correlated with the amount of money the subjects awarded victims. This suggests that brain activity measures racial bias with more practical validity, at least in this situation and with our sample size, than a common behavioral measure (the IAT). © 2012 Psychology Press.",

    "Abstract": "Blackjack players who \"count cards\" keep track of cards that have already been played and use this knowledge to turn the probability of winning in their favor. So long as card counters rely on their own memory and computational skills, they have violated no laws and can make sizable profits. When players use a \"device\" to help them count cards, however, they may be committing a serious crime.

    "Abstract": "This chapter presents some concluding thoughts. The chapters in this volume have aimed to provide a review of the current state of neuroscience with respect to the use of brainscanning devices to 'read' minds. Taken together, they should leave the reader wellinformed, both about the current state of progress and about the many concerns that these developments raise, especially in relation to mental privacy. The rudimentary capabilities for 'mindreading' demonstrated by brain imaging technologies also raise important concerns for mental privacy. While future advances may not be as dramatic as pessimists have feared, these concerns will not be dispelled without an open and informed scientific and public debate. © Oxford University Press, 2012.

    "Abstract": "This chapter argues that understanding the history of scientific and clinical imaging evidence is critical to informing analysis of the contemporary role of neuroscientific evidence in American legal culture. Justifying this thesis requires two principal tasks. First, it assesses the epistemic and evidentiary status of scientific and clinical images in late 19th- to early 20thcentury American legal culture. Second, it argues that through a deeper understanding of the social and cultural power of the scientific image in shaping contemporary American law of evidence, one is in a better position to evaluate the scope and significance of neuroimaging evidence in American legal culture. More specifically, while many neurolaw scholars warn of the potentially prejudicial effects of neuroimages, there is less scholarship explaining why it is that such neuroimages are any more likely to pose significant risks of undue prejudice than many other forms of scientific and medical evidence. © Oxford University Press, 2011.

The cognitive liberty touches central themes in transhumanist discourse related to cognitive enhancement and morphological freedom, and support a foundational right to cognitive self-design.

    "Abstract": "For a long time neuroscience has focused on basic research, but now studies have begun to demonstrate how brain science can be put to use to solve practical real-world problems. Specifically, research in human neuroimaging has led to the development of techniques that allow to accurately read out a person's conscious experience based only on non-invasive EEG and fMRI measurements of their brain activity. Such 'brain reading' is possible because each thought is associated with a unique pattern of brain activity that can serve as a 'fingerprint' of this thought in the brain. By training a computer to recognize these fMRI patterns associated with each thought it is possible to read out what someone is currently thinking with high accuracy. Despite these promising findings, there are still many limitations that make it unlikely that a 'universal thought reading machine' will be developed in the near future. Nonetheless, the first simple applications have begun to emerge, including brain-computer-interfaces, more reliable lie detectors and approaches for predicting consumer decisions. These raise ethical concerns related to mental privacy, data security and quality control. © Oxford University Press, 2012. All rights reserved.",

Their impact on the different social sciences, that is philosophy, psychology, marketing, educational sciences etc. is today accompanied by an interesting appearance in law. The neuroscience's datas arouse an increasing interest in the juridical (ou legal) sphere throughout the use of cerebral imaging methods or the prescription of neuropharmacological treatments.

    "Abstract": "Casey Hardison was arrested in spring 2004 for the production of psychedelictype drugs ie. LSD, 2C-B and DMT. In the three years since, not one person from ‘authority’ had bothered to ask him what motivated him to synthesise psychedelic drugs. It was as if the a priori assumption that ‘all illegal drugs are bad’ had provided the answer. Hence, the Judge asserted that Hardison did it for ‘that basest of human emotion, greed’ as though the psychospiritual benefits of an alchemical path dedicated to expanding consciousness and personal transformation, through insights integrated into action, upon which he had expounded at great lengths during trial, were some elaborate ‘portmanteau defence’, just some ruse to get him out of the dock. It was not, it was a committed stand for ‘cognitive liberty’ and for a world full of people who understand the fine line between alone and all one. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",

    "Abstract": "Michael Pardo and Dennis Patterson have recently put forward several provocative and stimulating criticisms that strike at the heart of much work that has been done at the crossroads of neuroscience and the law. My goal in this essay is to argue that their criticisms of the nascent but growing field of neurolaw are ultimately based on questionable assumptions concerning the nature of the ever evolving relationship between scientific discovery and ordinary language. For while the marriage between ordinary language and scientific discovery is admittedly not always a happy one, it is an awkward union that nevertheless seems to work itself out with the passage of time. In the following pages, I will try to show that Pardo and Patterson's primary argumentative strategy ultimately depends on basic assumptions concerning the fixity of language that we should reject. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Criminal behaviors have been associated with risk, time and social preferences in economics (Becker 1968; Davis 1988), criminology (Chamlin & Cochran 1997), and neurolaw (Goodenough & Tucker 2010). This study proposes a molecular neuroeconomic framework for the investigation into crime and punishment. Neuroeconomic parameters (e.g., risk-attitude, probability weighting, time discounting in intertemporal choice, loss aversion, and social discounting) are predicted to be related to criminal behavior. Neurobiological and neuroendocrinological substrates such as serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, cortisol (a stress hormone), sex hormones (e.g., testosterone), and oxytocin in brain regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the cingulate may be related to the neuroeconomic parameters governing criminal behaviors. The present framework may help us develop \"neurolaw\" based on molecular neuroeconomics of criminal and antisocial decision-making processes. © 2012 Neuroendocrinology Letters.",

    "Abstract": "The plaintiff ’s view of malingering will be examined here using principles enunciated in the emerging field of medical jurisprudence called “neurolaw.” Neurolaw is chieﬂy concerned with the medicolegal ramifications of neurological injuries-especially traumatic brain injury (TBI) (Taylor, 1991; Taylor, Harp, & Elliott, 1991). Since its inception, health professionals have embraced neurolaw, and several journals have devoted entire issues to its principles, e.g., NeuroRehabilitation, 16(2) (2001); Brain Injury Source, 4(3) (2000). Additionally, a legal treatise dealing with neurolaw has been published (Taylor, 1997). As we delineate the plaintiff ’s perspective on malingering, we shall review various tenets of neurolaw, so neuropsychologists may learn how neurolaw interfaces with neuropsychology. For now it suffices to say that much, if not all, of the plaintiff ’s perspective on malingering rests upon principles of neurolaw. © 2009 by Psychology Press.",

    "Abstract": "Clinical neuropsychologists engage increasingly in forensic consulting activities because such expert opinions are generally relevant, reliable and helpful in resolving certain legal claims, especially those related to traumatic brain injury. Consequently, practitioners of law, medicine and psychology would benefit from understanding the nature of neuropsychological evidence, the standards for its admissibility, and its expanding role in neurolaw. This article reviews important evidentiary rules regulating relevance, preliminary questions, and expert testimony, while tracing federal key court decisions and progeny. Civil and criminal cases are detailed to illustrate the application of these rules and case law to neuropsychological evidence, with suggestions for overcoming motions to exclude such evidence. Expert neuropsychologists have a role in forensic consultation on brain trauma cases, even as the interdisciplinary dialog and understanding among law, medicine, and psychology continues to expand. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "In some criminal law cases, the defendant is assessed by a forensic psychiatrist or psychologist within the context of an insanity defense. In this article I argue that specific neuroscientific research can be helpful in improving the quality of such a forensic psychiatric evaluation. This will be clarified in two ways. Firstly, we shall adopt the approach of understanding these forensic assessments as evaluations of the influence of a mental disorder on a defendant's decision-making process. Secondly, I shall point to the fact that researchers in neuroscience have performed various studies over recent years on the influence of specific mental disorders on a patient's decision-making. I argue that such research, especially if modified to decision-making in criminal scenarios, could be very helpful to forensic psychiatric assessments. This kind of research aims to provide insights not merely into the presence of a mental disorder, but also into the actual impact of mental disorders on the decisions defendants have made in regard to their actions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, I argue that companies who use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans for lie detection encounter the same basic ethical stumbling blocks as commercial companies that market traditional polygraphs. Markets in traditional voluntary polygraphs are common and fail to elicit much uproar among ethicists. Thus, for consistency, if markets in polygraphs are ethically unproblematic, markets using fMRIs for lie detection are equally as acceptable. Furthermore, while I acknowledge two substantial differences between the ethical concerns involving polygraphs and fMRI lie detection, I argue that these concerns can be overcome and do not lead to the conclusion that markets in fMRI lie detection are ethically dubious. It is my conclusion that voluntary markets in fMRI lie detection can be justified by consumer autonomy and should be allowed to persist. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Considerable information about mental states can be decoded from noninvasive measures of human brain activity. Analyses of brain activity patterns can reveal what a person is seeing, perceiving, attending to, or remembering. Moreover, multidimensional models can be used to investigate how the brain encodes complex visual scenes or abstract semantic information. Such feats of \"brain reading\" or \"mind reading,\" though impressive, raise important conceptual, methodological, and ethical issues. What does successful decoding reveal about the cognitive functions performed by a brain region? How should brain signals be spatially selected and mathematically combined to ensure that decoding reflects inherent computations of the brain rather than those performed by the decoder? We highlight recent advances and describe how multivoxel pattern analysis can provide a window into mind-brain relationships with unprecedented specificity, when carefully applied. However, as brain-reading technology advances, issues of neuroethics and mental privacy will be important to consider. © 2012 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "This section is dedicated to examining the subject Neuroethics and Neurolaw in Turkey. The development of medicine and related branches in Turkey generally demonstrates a parallelism with the examples from the similar countries in the world. In brief, the contemporary criterions are applicable to both education and daily practices of these fields. In this context, the headlines under the disciplines of neurology and neurosurgery shall be evaluated from the medical ethics and medical law points of view under the heading of scientific neurothics and neurolaws. Today, the worthiness problems related with the end of life constitute one of the most important subjects of discussion in medical ethics. In the neurology area, where this problem frequently arises, the commands: do not apply euthanasia and do not resuscitate are two important phenomena to be studied closely. A very crucial subject from the organ transplantation point of view is making the decision on the brain death. The specialists on neurosurgery and neurology in Turkey are legally tasked among the decision-making doctors in this subject. Therefore, this is one of the headings that will be discussed in the text from both ethical and deontological or medical law points of view. Thus, referring to an eternal problem of medicine terminating a life and also to a new concept the organ trade, belonging to the 21st century and which is the result of modern economical and political factors. The clinical researches shall be discussed as a rather discrete dimension of the daily doctor - patient relations under the heading of neurological sciences as a separate subsection within the text. Here, we shall discuss how the concept of informed consent may be applied to the patient and subject groups which the neurological sciences deal with in the normal daily medical applications and in research phases and the potential problems related with it. Another concept to be scrutinized here is how experimental treatments may be turned out to be a subject of hope trade in some communities. Finally, this section is a response given from a geography on the junction of Asia and Europe to the query of how different nations may develop different approaches to similar subjects from a neuroethics and neurolaw point of view. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

    "Abstract": "This is a report on the 3-day workshop \"The Neuroscience of Responsibility\" that was held in the Philosophy Department at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands during February 11th-13th, 2010. The workshop had 25 participants from The Netherlands, Germany, Italy, UK, USA, Canada and Australia, with expertise in philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry and law. Its aim was to identify current trends in neurolaw research related specifically to the topic of responsibility, and to foster international collaborative research on this topic. The workshop agenda was constructed by the participants at the start of each day by surveying the topics of greatest interest and relevance to participants. In what follows, we summarize (1) the questions which participants identified as most important for future research in this field, (2) the most prominent themes that emerged from the discussions, and (3) the two main international collaborative research project plans that came out of this meeting. © 2010 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "The spread of neuroimaging technologies around the world has led to diverse practices of forensic psychiatry and the emergence of neuroethics and neurolaw. This article surveys the neuroethics and neurolegal literature on the use of forensic neuroimaging within the courtroom. Next, the related literature within medical anthropology and science and technology studies is reviewed to show how debates about forensic neuroimaging reflect cultural tensions about attitudes regarding the self, mental illness, and medical expertise. Finally, recommendations are offered on how forensic psychiatrists can add to this research, given their professional interface between law and medicine. At stake are the fundamental concerns that surround changing conceptions of the self, sickness, and expectations of medicine.",

    "Abstract": "Developers of NBIC (Nano-Bio-Info-Cogno) technologies face a multitude of obstacles, not the least of which is navigating the public ethics of their applied research. Biotechnologies have received widespread media attention and spawned heated interest in their perceived social implications. Now, in view of the rapidly expanding purview of neuroscience and the growing array of technologic developments capable of affecting or monitoring cognition, the emerging field of neuroethics calls for a consideration of the social and ethical implications of neuroscientific discoveries and trends. To negotiate the complex ethical issues at stake in new and emerging kinds of technologies for improving human cognition, we need to overcome political, disciplinary, and religious sectarianism. We need analytical models that protect values of personhood at the heart of a functional democracy - values that allow, as much as possible, for individual decision-making, despite transformations in our understanding and ability to manipulate cognitive processes. Addressing cognitive enhancement from the legal and ethical notion of \"cognitive liberty\" provides a powerful tool for assessing and encouraging NBIC developments.",

    "Abstract": "This book addresses the use and regulation of traditional drugs such as peyote, ayahuasca, coca leaf, cannabis, khat and Salvia divinorum. The uses of these substances can often be found at the intersection of diverse areas of life, including politics, medicine, shamanism, religion, aesthetics, knowledge transmission, socialization, and celebration. The collection analyzes how some of these psychoactive plants have been progressively incorporated and regulated in developed Western societies by both national legislation and by the United Nations Drug Conventions. It focuses mainly, but not only, on the debates in court cases around the world involving the claim of religious use and the legal definitions of \"religion.\" It further touches upon issues of human rights and cognitive liberty as they relate to the consumption of drugs. While this collection emphasizes certain uses of psychoactive substances in different cultures and historical periods, it is also useful for thinking about the consumption of drugs in general in contemporary societies. The cultural and informal controls discussed here represent alternatives to the current merely prohibitionist policies, which are linked to the spread of illicit and violent markets. By addressing the disputes involved in the regulation of traditional drug use, this volume reflects on notions such as origin, place, authenticity, and tradition, thereby relating drug policy to broader social science debates. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

    "Abstract": "This article comments on the agreement signed in 2010 between a US branch of the Brazilian ayahuasca religion União do Vegetal (UDV) and the US Drug Enforcement Agency. This document settles a dispute regarding administrative issues involving ayahuasca, a psychoactive brew used by this group as a religious sacrament. The government originally confiscated this substance in 1999, and the matter went to the Supreme Court, which handed down a decision favourable to the UDV in 2006. Despite the fact that this group prevailed, the agreement reveals that the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) views ayahuasca not as a religious sacrament, but as a toxic and hazardous compound. This article also contextualizes this agreement in relation to the history of the UDV, which has been expanding beyond the Amazon since the 1970s. This process entailed increasing levels of institutionalization, formalization and bureaucratization. In its search for social legitimacy and legal conformity, the group has gradually shifted from its popular Amazonian origins. This process reached its peak with the current agreement with the DEA. Nevertheless, the agreement surpassed the levels of control and interference that would be tolerated by these religions in Brazil. It raises serious concerns for all those interested in human rights, religious freedom and cognitive liberty. Copyright © 2011 Informa UK Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "Given the rapid advancements in neuroscience and its growing involvement in legal proceedings, in this paper, we aim to address the question of whether and to which extent Greek legislation could be revisited in the light of the most recent neuroscientific discoveries. Reading the human cognitive and emotional functions by modern neuroscientific technology is relevant to a number of Greek legal provisions, an overview of which is presented in this paper. In the first chapter, we describe the general framework that governs an adult's capacity of will, taking into consideration the constitutional aspect, the civil law's approach and some special topics concerning medical law and research, with the aim to examine how these issues could be illuminated with a neuroscientific perspective. The second chapter is exclusively dedicated to criminal law, in an effort to evaluate the potential influence of neuroscience on the Greek criminal justice system. The penal legislation concerning the assessment of criminal responsibility, the evaluation of the sentence, and the admissibility of neuroscientific techniques in criminal Courts, as well as some special issues concerning juvenile offenders and crime prevention are presented. Finally, a unique Greek case where the use of a lie detector was permitted in the context of a criminal trial is cited and briefly analysed. This overview leads to conclude that although the Greek legal system refers extensively to situations of interest for neurolaw, the acceptance of neuroscientific methods for determining the cognitive or mental status of persons involved in civil, medical and criminal relationships is rarely considered as important. However, the aforementioned judicial step towards the acceptance of these methods in criminal settings, as well as the innovative spirit that the Greek legislator shows in regulating biomedical matters during the last decades, lead to consider that a revision of the Greek legislation in the light of new neuroscience, should not be excluded for the future. Providing more information on neurolaw and its expected benefits could be, perhaps, the best motivation for taking action in this promising field. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

    "Abstract": "As a reaction to the rapid developments in modern neurosciences, the French legislator proposed the implementation of neuroscientific rules in the French Law on Bioethics in January 2010. Neuroscientific research has indeed not yet been covered by any national code or international treaty and opinions are highly divided with a view to the legal framework for neuroscientific research. Notably incidental findings in brain imaging research pose a big challenge for both the researcher and the participant. They might cause psychological distress, social stigma, and severe financial burdens on the participant's side and the researcher might be confronted with civil claims for damages or even render himself liable to prosecution. Therefore, it is going to be analyzed in a first step if the insertion of neurospecific rules in the Law on Bioethics could shed light on the management of incidental findings and the regulation of neuroscientific research. Another important issue in neurolaw is that of the recent application possibilities of neuroimaging techniques such as the use of fMRI scanners as lie detectors in courts or as communication methods for vegetative state patients. Even if these procedures are not yet a daily occurrence in France, it is an important time to consider the civil, criminal, and constitutional consequences in a second step. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

    "Abstract": "The neuropeptide oxytocin functions as a hormone and neurotransmitter and facilitates complex social cognition and approach behavior. Given that empathy is an essential ingredient for third-party decision-making in institutions of justice, we investigated whether exogenous oxytocin modulates empathy of an unaffected third-party toward offenders and victims of criminal offenses. Healthy male participants received intranasal oxytocin or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subjects design. Participants were given a set of legal vignettes that described an event during which an offender engaged in criminal offenses against victims. As an unaffected third-party, participants were asked to rate those criminal offenses on the degree to which the offender deserved punishment and how much harm was inflicted on the victim. Exogenous oxytocin selectively increased third-party decision-makers' perceptions of harm for victims but not the desire to punish offenders of criminal offenses. We argue that oxytocin promoted empathic concern for the victim, which in turn increased the tendency for prosocial approach behavior regarding the interpersonal relationship between an unaffected third-party and a fictional victim in the criminal scenarios. Future research should explore the context- and person-dependent nature of exogenous oxytocin in individuals with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy, in whom deficits in empathy feature prominently. © The Author (2012).

    "Abstract": "Recent years have seen an explosion in research by scholars from the social sciences and humanities who apply neuroscience to research in their home disciplines. One way these 'neuroscholars' have engaged in conversations with neuroscience is by incorporating books of popular neuroscience into their work. This chapter explores some of the textual changes that result from the translation of neuroscience to popular neuroscience, and through rhetorical analysis, examines how popular neuroscience is used to support claims in emerging disciplines like neuroeconomics, neuroliterary criticism, neurolaw, and neuroeducation. An examination of scholarship from several disciplines - including sociology - reveals that popular neuroscience is often marshaled not as a translation or accommodation of science, but as science itself via two primary rhetorical strategies we have termed 'fact finding' and 'theory building.

    "Abstract": "The current definition of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is in flux. Presently, there are at least three working definitions of this disorder in the United States, with no clear consensus. Functional neuroimaging, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), initially showed promise in their ability to improve the diagnostic credibility of MTBI. Over the past decade, that promise has not been fulfilled and there is a paucity of quality studies or standards for the application of functional neuroimaging to traumatic brain injury, particularly in litigation. The legal profession is ahead of the science in this matter. The emergence of neurolaw is driving a growing use of functional neuroimaging, as a sole imaging modality, used by lawyers in an attempt to prove MTBI at trial. The medical literature on functional neuroimaging and its applications to MTBI is weak scientifically, sparse in quality publications, lacking in well-designed controlled studies, and currently does not meet the complete standards of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for introduction of scientific evidence at trial. At the present time, there is a clear lack of clinical correlation between functional neuroimaging of MTBI and behavioral, neuropsychological, or structural neuroimaging deficits. The use of SPECT or PET, without concurrent clinical correlation with structural neuroimaging (CT or MRI), is not recommended to be offered as evidence of MTBI in litigation.",

    "Abstract": "Interpreting the world through a social lens is a central characteristic of human cognition. Humans ascribe intentions to the behaviors of other individuals and groups. Humans also make inferences about others' emotional and mental states. This capacity for social attribution underlies many of the concepts at the core of legal and political systems. The developing scientific understanding of the neural mechanisms used in social attribution may alter many earlier suppositions. However, just as often, these new methods will lead back to old conundrums. Cognitive neuroscience will not dispel the hard problems of social judgment. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

    "Abstract": "The growing use of brain imaging technology and the developing of cognitive neuroscience pose unaccustomed challenges to legal systems. Until now, the fields of Law much affected are the civil and criminal law and procedure, but the constitutional dimension of \"neurolaw\" cannot be easily underestimated. As the capacity to investigate and to trace brain mechanisms and functional neural activities increases, it becomes urgent the recognition and definition of the unalienable rights and fundamental values in respect of this new techno-scientific power, that must be protected and safeguard at \"constitutional level\" of norms such as: human dignity, personal identity, authenticity and the pursuit of individual \"happiness\". As the same as for the law regulating research and experimentation on human genome adopted in the past years, one may also argue if the above mentioned fundamental principles of \"neurolaw\" must be fixed and disciplined also at European and International level.",

    "Abstract": "The widespread use and novel applications of brain imaging techniques seem to open the possibility of new threats to one's privacy. Being in a situation where we cannot control what information about ourselves is available to others could restrict the jobs we can get, the business we conduct, the way we are seen by strangers, and the way we relate to our friends and family. While researchers and practitioners should be cautious about the ways they use brain imaging data, we argue that brain reading does not violate privacy in any way different from the already established psychological methods to determine mental phenomena, such as whether someone suffers from color blindness or is clinically depressed. For brain reading to constitute a new threat, we claim it would have to be possible to easily gather information about a subject's mental states in accidental or malicious ways without the knowledge of the subject. Against this possibility, we note that brain imaging techniques require (i) the researchers to intentionally seek a specific type of mental state to the exclusion of information about other states, (ii) the active cooperation and participation of subjects, and (iii) a method of analysis that depends on the already established psychological tests. Hence, while there should be policies that specify when brain imaging can be used and how, these policies should be treated within a broader context of privacy issues in psychology rather than as a special case.",

    "Abstract": "Law and neuroscience (sometimes neurolaw) has become a recognized field of study. The advances of neuroscience are proving useful in solving some perennial challenges of legal scholarship and are leading to applications in law and policy. While caution is appropriate in considering neurolaw approaches, the new knowledge should-and will-be put to use. Areas of special attention in current neurolaw scholarship include (a) techniques for the objective investigation of subjective states such as pain, memory, and truth-telling; (b) evidentiary issues for admitting neuroscience facts and approaches into a court proceeding; (c) free will, responsibility, moral judgment, and punishment; (d) juvenile offenders; (e) addiction; (f) mental health; (g) bias; (h) emotion; and (i) the neuroeconomics of decision making and cooperation. The future of neurolaw will be more productive if challenges to collaboration between lawyers and scientists can be resolved. Copyright © 2010 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "Neuroethics and neurolaw are fields of study that involve the interface of neuroscience with clinical and legal decision-making. The past two decades have seen increasing attention being paid to both fields, in large part because of the advances in neuroimaging techniques and improved ability to visualize and measure brain structure and function. Traumatic brain injury (TBI), along with its acute and chronic sequelae, has emerged as a focus of neuroethical issues, such as informed consent for treatment and research, diagnostic and prognostic uncertainties, and the subjectivity of interpretation of data. The law has also more frequently considered TBI in criminal settings for exculpation, mitigation and sentencing purposes and in tort and administrative law for personal injury, disability and worker's compensation cases. This article provides an overview of these topics with an emphasis on the current challenges that the neuroscience of TBI faces in the medicolegal arena. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "Abstract": "This chapter focuses on the possible impact of neuroscientific technological development on one area of privacy in particular: the privacy that we enjoy in relation to the contents of our minds or, as it has come to be called, 'mental privacy'. Many people are horrified by the thought that we might develop mindreading capability. An informal survey generated adjectives such as 'appalling', 'invasive', 'intrusive', and 'terrifying'; it has been suggested that having one's thoughts exposed was akin to 'mental rape'; allusions have been made to Big Brother and thought police. The chapter considers whether this immediate 'gut' reaction is justified. It shows that when the possibility of mental transparency is examined more carefully, and without prejudicial assumptions, it turns out to be less completely alarming than we think. It examines the potential impact of transparency in various situations, and finds that there might even be some 'pros', alongside the obvious 'cons'. © Oxford University Press, 2012.

    "Abstract": "The voluminous writings of Ludwig Wittgenstein contain some of the most profound reflections of our time on the nature of the human subject and self-understanding - the human condition, philosophically speaking. This book mimes those extensive writings for a conception of the self. And more specifically, the book offers a discussion of Wittgenstein's later writings on language and mind as they hold special significance for the understanding and clarification of the distinctive character of self-descriptive or autobiographical language. The book also undertakes a philosophical investigation of selected autobiographical writings - among the best examples we have of human selves exploring themselves - as they cast new and special light on the critique of mind-body dualism and its undercurrents in particular, and on the nature of autobiographical consciousness more generally. The chapters take up in turn the topics of self-consciousness, what Wittgenstein calls 'the inner picture'; mental privacy and the picture of metaphysical seclusion; the very idea of our observation of the contents of consciousness; first-person expressive speech; reflexive or self-directed thought and competing pictures of introspection; the nuances of retrospective self-understanding, person-perception, and the corollary issues of self-perception (itself an interestingly dangerous phrase); self-defining memory; and the therapeutic conception of philosophical progress as it applies to all of these issues. The cast of characters interwoven throughout the discussion include, in addition to Wittgenstein centrally, Augustine, Goethe, Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Iris Murdoch, Donald Davidson, and Stanley Cavell, among others. © Garry L.

    "Abstract": "We outline the framework of the new project of Critical Neuroscience: a reflexive scientific practice that responds to the social, cultural and political challenges posed by the advances in the behavioural and brain sciences. Indeed, the new advances in neuroscience have given rise to growing projects of the sociology of neuroscience as well as neuroethics. In parallel, however, there is also a growing gulf between social studies of neuroscience and empirical neuroscience itself. This is where Critical Neuroscience finds its place. Here, we begin with a sketch of several forms of critique that can contribute to developing a model of critical scientific practice. We then describe a set of core activities that jointly make up the practice of Critical Neuroscience as it can be applied and practised both within and outside of neuroscience. We go on to propose three possible areas of application: (1) the problems related to new possibilities of neuropharmacological interventions; (2) the importance of culture, and the problems of reductionism, in psychiatry; (3) the use of imaging data from neuroscience in the law as alleged evidence about ‘human nature’. © 2009, London School of Economics and Political Science.",

    "Abstract": "Federal regulations governing human subjects research do not address key questions raised by incidental neuroimaging findings, including the scope of a researcher's disclosure with respect to the possibility of incidental findings and the question whether a researcher has an affirmative legal cuty to seek, detect, and report incidental findings. The scope of researcher duties may, however, be mapped with reference to common law doctrine, including fiduciary, tort, contract, and bailment theories of liability. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Various authors debate the question of whether neuroscience is relevant to criminal responsibility. However, a plethora of different techniques and technologies, each with their own abilities and drawbacks, lurks beneath the label \"neuroscience\"; and in criminal law responsibility is not a single, unitary and generic concept, but it is rather a syndrome of at least six different concepts. Consequently, there are at least six different responsibility questions that the criminal law asks-at least one for each responsibility concept-and, I will suggest, a multitude of ways in which the techniques and technologies that comprise neuroscience might help us to address those diverse questions. In a way, on my account neuroscience is relevant to criminal responsibility in many ways, but I hesitate to state my position like this because doing so obscures two points which I would rather highlight: one, neither neuroscience nor criminal responsibility are as unified as that; and two, the criminal law asks many different responsibility questions and not just one generic question. © 2009 The Author(s).",

Allopatic liberties and rights to medical practice in asylums, clinics, courts, hospitals, prisons and schools were never certain.

    "Abstract": "Legislators, jurists, and advocates often turn to science to solve complicated normative problems addressed by the law. This article addresses what motivates these parties, surveys the psychology of law and its concepts of the person and responsibility, and describes the general relation of neuroscience to law in terms of the issue of \"translation.\" Numerous distractions have clouded our understanding of the relationship between scientific, causal accounts of behavior and responsibility. The notion of \"NeuroLaw\" is examined here in detail, with the conclusion that a cautious optimism regarding the contributions of neuroscience to the law is warranted. © 2012 by Federal Legal Publications, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "This article investigates the neurolaw in Brazil, the largest country in Latin America. It concludes that though studies in neuroscience have great exponents in the country, there is not, still, a Brazilian neurolaw - probably owing to the traditional distance the Brazilian law has in relation to sciences and the social reality. But, already counting with several mentions of aspects of neuroscience in court decisions, albeit low qualified, and in face of some recent studies on neurolaw that are being produced, there are signs of a promising future development of the area. This article also brings an overview of the country to foreigners: its organizational structure, the way some of its important institutions acts, recent data about scientific research, and the main rules that must be followed by those who wish to do research in the country. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

    "Abstract": "Traumatic brain injury has received significant attention in recent years. Advances in diagnosis and management have resulted in opportunities to improve patient outcomes; however, controversies in diagnosis and management have resulted in increased interactions between the medical and legal communities. This article highlights some of the areas of controversy in traumatic brain injury litigation with the hope that synchronous resolutions of both legal and medical issues will ultimately benefit patient care. It is imperative that the neuroscience community engage the legal community to facilitate an understanding of the issues and their ramifications. Proactive communication and understanding between medical and legal specialties offer the potential to maximize efficiencies in our health care and legal systems. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "This paper reviews the impact of ten years of domestic incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on the evolution of the United Kingdom's primary piece of prohibitive drugs legislation, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The significant cases where traditional interpretation of this Act has been challenged in the courts using the Convention are discussed. Structured thematically, this paper looks at the interplay between drug prohibition and human rights in addressing complex issues, such as our right to self-medicate, to practice our religion(s) freely, and to explore our own consciousness. The intention is to expose the untapped potential of the ECHR as a tool with which to fundamentally challenge the (discriminatory) drug policy of the United Kingdom. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Neuroscientific evidence is increasingly reaching United States courtrooms in a number of legal contexts. Just in calendar year 2010, the U.S. legal system saw its first evidentiary hearing in federal court on the admissibility of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) lie-detection evidence; the first admission of quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) evidence contributing in part to a reduced sentence in a homicide case; and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling explicitly citing brain development research. Additional indicators suggest rapid growth. The number of cases in the U.S. involving neuroscientific evidence doubled from 2006 to 2009. And since 2000, the number of English-language law review articles including some mention of neuroscience has increased fourfold. In 2008 and again in 2009, more than 200 published scholarly works mentioned neuroscience. The data clearly suggest that there is growing interest on the part of law professors, and growing demand on the part of law reviews, for scholarship on law and the brain (Shen 2010). In addition, a number of symposia on law and neuroscience have been held in the United States over the past few years, and despite the notable youth of the field, courses in Law and Neuroscience have been taught at a number of U.S. law schools. This vivid interest in neurolaw, from both scholars and practitioners, is born of the technological developments that allow noninvasive detection of brain activities. But despite the rapid increase of legal interest in neuroscientific evidence, it remains unclear how the U.S. legal system - at the courtroom, regulatory, and policy levels - will resolve the many challenges that new neuroscience applications raise. The emerging field of law and neuroscience is being built on a foundation joining: (a) rapidly developing technologies and techniques of neuroscience; (b) quickly expanding legal scholarship on implications of neuroscience; and (c) (more recently) neuroscientific research designed specifically to explore legally relevant topics. With the institutional support of many of the country's top research universities, as well as the support of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, among other private foundations and public funding agencies, the U.S. is well positioned to continue contributing to international developments in neurolaw. This chapter provides an overview of notable neurolaw developments in the United States. The chapter proceeds in six parts. Section 1 introduces the development of law and neuroscience in the United States. Section 2 then considers several of the evidentiary contexts in which neuroscience has been, and likely will be, introduced. Sections 3 and 4 discuss the implications of neuroscience for the criminal and civil systems, respectively. Section 5 reviews three special topics: lie detection, memory, and legal decision-making. Section 6 concludes with brief thoughts about the future of law and neuroscience in the United States. As judges, lawyers, legislators, and the public become more acquainted with neuroscientific evidence, and as neuroscience continues to produce more legally relevant findings, it is likely that we will see continued expansion of law and neuroscience in the United States. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

    "Abstract": "Since the 1980s, MRI scanners have told us much about brain function and played an important role in the clinical diagnosis of a number of conditions-both in the brain and the rest of the body. Their routine use has made the diagnosis of brain tumours and brain damage both quicker and more accurate. However, some neuroscientific advances, in particular those that relate specifically to the mind have provoked excitement and discussion in a number of disciplines. One of the most thought provoking developments in recent neuroscience has been the progress made with 'mind-reading'. There seems nothing more private than one's thoughts, some of which we might choose to share with others, and some not. Yet, until now, little has been published on the particular issue of privacy in relation to 'brain' or 'mind' reading. This book presents an interdisciplinary account of the neuroscientific evidence on 'mind reading', as well as a thorough analysis of both legal and moral accounts of privacy. The book considers such issues as the use of imaging to detect awareness in those considered to be in a vegetative state. It looks at issues of mental imaging and national security, the neurobiology of violence, and issues regarding diminished responsibility in criminals, and thus reduced punishment. It also considers how the use of neuroimaging can and should be regulated. © Oxford University Press, 2012. All rights reserved.",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, attempts have increasingly been made to connect neuroscience and law. Scientists and lawyers are imagining and actively fostering the realization of futures in which neuroscience will play a prominent role in the activity of courts. In this article I take these debates as my empirical object. I trace the emergence of neurolegal discourse, explore its focus on free will and lie detection, and show how expectations about the potential role neuroscience might play in the law are being embedded in new research programs and funding streams. In so doing, I analyze the role of particular \"sociotechnical imaginaries\" in stimulating, directing and restricting neurolegal discourse and highlight the ways in which new visions of law, science and scientists are produced in the process. Sociotechnical imaginaries are shown to be salient in structuring anticipatory discourse, and represent a key target for social scientific intervention in such debates. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "This research explores parents' perceptions of the privacy needs and behaviors of their preschool-age children. The literature suggests that children require some degree of choice over interaction with others to create a sense of autonomy. Research into children's privacy focuses on spatial control as the primary method of achieving privacy. A model is constructed based on Laufer and Wolfe's multidimensional approach. Interviews with parents reveal the complexity involved in everyday decisions regarding children's privacy. Results indicate that parents do not perceive privacy as important for young children and more likely see them as invaders of others' privacy. Parents are partially aware of the influence of age and gender on children's privacy needs. Respondents perceived their children's privacy needs in spatial terms, less often recognized the need for body privacy, and rarely valued mental privacy for their children. Also, parents view their children's motivations for seeking privacy in primarily negative terms.",

    "Abstract": "Various kinds of normative judgments are an integral part of everyday life. We extended the scrutiny of social cognitive neuroscience into the domain of legal decisions, investigating two groups, lawyers and other academics, during moral and legal decision-making. While we found activation of brain areas comprising the so-called 'moral brain' in both conditions, there was stronger activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and middle temporal gyrus particularly when subjects made legal decisions, suggesting that these were made in respect to more explicit rules and demanded more complex semantic processing. Comparing both groups, our data show that behaviorally lawyers conceived themselves as emotionally less involved during normative decision-making in general. A group × condition interaction in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex suggests a modulation of normative decision-making by attention based on subjects' normative expertise. © The Author (2010).

    "Abstract": "This chapter explores the possible effects of new neuroscientific evidence on civil recovery and damage awards for emotional injuries in the American tort system. The chapter presents new experimental evidence suggesting that neuroscientific evidence of PTSD, so long as it is contested in court, is not likely to lead to greater monetary awards from juries. But the experimental results also suggest that cognitive neuroscience may challenge existing legal distinctions between \"bodily\" and \"mental\" injury. How novel neuroscientific evidence is translated into statutory law and policy may thus have significant ramifications for civil recovery. Neuroscience research, if utilized by both sides, may have a net neutral effect on PTSD litigation. But if one side, or even one litigator, moves quickly and moves first, there may be significant gains to be realized from monetizing memory science. © Oxford University Press, 2014.",

    "Abstract": "Spanish culture has recently shown interest about Neuroethics, a new line of research and reflection. It can be said that two general, and somewhat opposing, perspectives are currently being developed in Spain about neuroethics-related topics. One originates from the neuroscientific field and the other from the philosophical field. We will see, throughout this article, that the Spanish authors, who I am going to select here, deal with very diverse neuroethical topics and that they analyse them from different intellectual assumptions. However, I consider that there is one constant concern, which emerges extensively or briefly in each one of the books that I am going to present. I am referring to the problem of freedom. Spanish neuroscientists, in general, stress and accept the new determinism that emanates from recent research about the brain, whilst those who engage in the study of philosophy usually point in their texts to the limitations of empirical research that purport to «demonstrate» the new neurological determinism. I will dedicate the last section, which is more extensive in length, to the work that I consider the most valuable, at least until the present day, and whose title is Neuroética y Neuropolítica (Tecnos, Madrid, 2011). Professor Adela Cortina (chair of Moral Philosophy at Valencia University and member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Moral and Political Science) is its author. But, firstly, I am going to refer to the works written by neuroscientists, and then to those written by philosophers. This will enable us to obtain a global view of the neuroethics models that are being constructed in Spain. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, the author analyses the issues connected to emerging neurotechnologies, in particular their effects on (legal) concepts like capacity, liability, testimony, and evidence, and also on fundamental constitutional rights and freedoms like the right to autonomy and the right not to be treated without consent (in the general framework of the principle of human dignity). Starting from preliminary remarks on the key-concepts of neuroethics/technoethics, neurolaw/technolaw, the author investigates how personal liability is changing in the framework of new scientific developments. The paper underlines that neurolaw challenges some of the traditional legal institutions in the field of law (e.g., criminal law). From the point of view of ethics, the paper concludes that neuroethics is not challenged by the data coming from the use of emerging neurotechnologies, but human self-perception is strongly affected by it.

    "Abstract": "At the intersection of neuroscience and psychological science stands neuropsychology, providing patients, triers of fact, and other parties a quantifiable, evidence-based method for understanding cognitive, emotional, and behavioral changes that occur in the context of injury or disease. The purposes of this special issue of Psychological Injury and Law are to (1) illustrate the ways in which neuroscience, psychological practice, professional ethics, and laws are intertwined in the evaluation and treatment of persons who have been injured or are experiencing a neurological disease, (2) demonstrate the ways in which neuropsychological practice is applied to forensic questions, and (3) promote quality neuropsychological practice and services to patients, courts, and other consumers of neuropsychological services. This special issue provides a sample of the types of ways that practitioners integrate neuroscience and clinical psychology, informed by and consistent with relevant laws and professional ethics, to understand people who have cognitive, emotional, and/or behavioral problems stemming from neurological injuries or other disorders. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

    "Abstract": "Over the last 30 years the forensic use of brain scanning technology in court has increased considerably. In the U. S. about two thirds of opinions involving positron emission tomography/single photon emission computed tomography (PET/SPECT) evidence are ruled admissible in court and often have a decisive impact on judges and juries. Undoubtedly, the impressive progress in modern functional imaging techniques has improved the differentiated knowledge on the neural basis of discrete aspects of crime-related cognition and behavior. However, there are several general issues which make it difficult to draw individual deductions concerning behavioral patterns from functional imaging results. By analyzing cases from the courtroom, the question will be addressed as to how far neuroimaging-based expert opinions are really supported by concrete findings in neurobiological research. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

    "Abstract": "In the field of 'neurolaw', reformists claim that recent scientific discoveries from the mind sciences have serious ramifications for how legal responsibility should be adjudicated, but conservatives deny that this is so. In contrast, I criticise both of these polar opposite positions by arguing that although scientific findings can have often-weighty normative significance, they lack the normative authority with which reformists often imbue them. After explaining why conservatives and reformists are both wrong, I then offer my own moderate suggestions about what views we have reason to endorse. My moderate position reflects the familiar capacitarian idea which underlies much lay, legal, and philosophical thinking about responsibility-namely, that responsibility tracks mental capacity. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",

    "Abstract": "Will neuroscience revolutionize forensic practice and our legal institutions? In the debate about the legal implications of brain research, free will and the neural bases of antisocial or criminal behavior are of central importance. By analyzing frequently quoted examples for the unconscious determinants of behavior and antisocial personality changes caused by brain lesions in a wider psychological and social context, the paper argues for a cautious middle position: Evidence for an impending normative \"neuro-revolution\" is scarce and neuroscience may instead gradually improve legal practice in the long run, particularly where normative questions directly pertain to brain-related questions. In the conclusion the paper raises concerns that applying neuroscience methods about an individual's responsibility or dangerousness is premature at the present time and carries serious individual and societal risks. Putting findings from brain research in wider contexts renders them empirically investigable in a way that does not neglect psychological and social aspects of human mind and behavior. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "If he be a man engaged in any important inquiry, he must have a method, and he will be under a strong and constant temptation to make a metaphysics out of his method, that is, to suppose the universe ultimately of such a sort that his method must be appropriate and successful. E. A. Burtt, The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science (1925). In this nascent age of “neurolaw”, “neuromarketing”, “neuropolicy”, “neuroethics”, “neurophilosophy”, “neuroeconomics”, and even “neurotheology”, it becomes necessary to disentangle the science from the scientism. There is a host of cultural entrepreneurs currently grasping at various forms of authority through appropriations of neuroscience, presented to us in the corresponding dialects of neurotalk. Such talk is often accompanied by a picture of a brain scan, that fast-acting solvent of critical faculties. Elsewhere in this issue, O. Carter Snead offers a critique of the use of brain scans in the courtroom in which he alludes to, but ultimately brackets, questions about the scientific rigor of such use. For the sake of argument, he proceeds on the assumption that neuroimaging is competent to do what it is often claimed to do, namely, provide a picture of human cognition. But there are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the interpretation of brain scans as pictures of mentation. In parsing these problems, it becomes apparent that the current “neuro” enthusiasm should be understood in the larger context of scientism, a pervasive cultural tendency with its own logic. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",
