The International Organization for Migration (IOM), as part of its Missing Migrants Project, collects data on migrants who have died at the external borders of States or in the process of migrating towards an international destination, including as a result of transport accidents, shipwrecks or violent attacks or owing to medical complications during their journeys. Some missing migrants could be victims of disappearance, including enforced disappearance. The principal distinctive element between a migrant going missing and a migrant becoming a victim of disappearance is the commission of a crime against a migrant, as provided in articles 2, 3 and 5 of the Convention."

However, accurate data on the number of victims of disappearance among missing migrants are not available or are inaccurate, 12 owing to a lack of systematic data collection and shared databases, insufficient cooperation among States and lack of political will, barriers (linked, inter alia, to the situation of vulnerability of migrants and their relatives) to reporting cases of disappearance falling under articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, and the failure of authorities to conduct serious, effective and diligent searches and investigations. This lack of accurate and disaggregated data hinders the adoption of policies and strategies to prevent the enforced disappearance of migrants and increases the vulnerability of migrants to becoming victims of this crime."

States parties that are countries of origin should create a register of their nationals who have disappeared abroad and States parties that are countries of origin, transit, destination or return should ensure that the registration of migrants at border control points involves the individual examination of all applications for entry so as to allow for an effective search in the event of a person’s disappearance.

        "Text": "Pushbacks, and any other form of collective expulsion that do not allow for an individual assessment, constitute a flagrant violation of article 16 of the Convention. In the absence of an internationally agreed legal definition of the term, the Committee considers that pushbacks constitute measures taken by States, sometimes involving third countries or non-State actors, which result in migrants being summarily forced back, without an individual assessment of their human rights protection needs, to the country or territory, or to sea, whether it be territorial waters or international waters, from where they attempted to cross or crossed an international border. The Committee is of the view that, when pushbacks involve the deprivation of liberty of migrants and the concealment of their fate or whereabouts, they amount to enforced disappearance within the meaning of article 2 of the Convention, regardless of the duration of the deprivation of liberty. They may also constitute a violation of articles 17 and 18, which prohibit secret detention and guarantee the right of access to information about persons deprived of their liberty, and of other articles of the Convention, depending on the circumstances. The same applies to cases where pushbacks are carried out by non-State actors or intergovernmental organizations that act with the support, authorization or acquiescence of the State party. In addition, the seizure and destruction of individuals’ personal belongings, identity documents or mobile phones after their apprehension may lead to enforced disappearance, given that individuals are left without any means to communicate their whereabouts to relatives or prove their identity."

        "Text": "By obstructing access to applicable legal frameworks and procedural safeguards, pushbacks place migrants outside the protection of the law, make them vulnerable and may result in human rights violations incompatible with States’ obligations under international human rights law. Such obligations concern not only the prohibition of refoulement and collective expulsion, but also the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the right to liberty and the right to life. Pushbacks that do not involve the deprivation of liberty also raise grave concerns because they effectively remove the persons subjected to them from any protection of the law and contribute to a risk of disappearance. The Committee strongly urges States parties to refrain from such practices, including chain pushbacks, and from indirect pushbacks that result from a deliberate failure to search and rescue at sea or on land. States parties, therefore, must refrain from conducting pushbacks, must effectively investigate, prosecute and punish any allegations of such practices and must not deny their occurrence."

In migration contexts, cases of disappearance are often not reported, for example, owing to obstacles faced by relatives living in another country, language, cultural or knowledge barriers and fear among relatives or witnesses who may themselves have an irregular migratory status. Authorities should initiate the search and investigation ex officio as soon as they become aware of or have indications, through any means, that a person has been subjected to disappearance. The burden of proof should not be on the victims or relatives."

Moreover, witnesses or relatives must be able to report disappearance without fear of reprisals, including deportation or deprivation of liberty. States parties should therefore create functional and accessible mechanisms to enable the reporting of a disappearance from another country, and promptly alert the competent authorities of the country in which the alleged disappearance took place."

Investigations of cases of the disappearance of migrants must be transparent, thorough and impartial and must adopt a differential approach that considers the structural vulnerability of migrants and the intersectional vulnerability of particular groups of migrants, such as women, children, members of LGBTQI+ communities and those belonging to certain ethnic or racial groups."
