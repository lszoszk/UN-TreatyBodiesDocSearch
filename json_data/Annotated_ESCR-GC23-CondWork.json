Where workers have precarious contracts, supplements to the wage, as well as other measures to guard against arbitrariness, may be necessary in the interests of fairness to mitigate the lack of job security. Workers should not have to pay back part of their wage for work already performed and should receive all wages and benefits legally due upon termination of contracts or in event of the bankruptcy or judicial liquidation of the employer. Employers are prohibited from restricting freedom of workers to dispose of their remuneration. Prisoners who accept to work should receive a fair wage.

Such measures can also contribute towards a better balance between work and family responsibilities provided they respond to the different requirements and challenges faced by men and women workers. Flexible working arrangements must meet the needs of both workers and employers and in no case should they be used to undermine the right to just and favourable conditions of work."

        "Text": "The right to just and favourable conditions of work relates to specific workers:\r\n(i) Women workers: Progress on the three key interrelated indicators for gender equality in the context of labour rights – the ‘glass ceiling’, the ‘gender pay gap’ and the ‘sticky floor’ - remain far from satisfactory. Intersectional discrimination and the absence of a life-cycle approach regarding the needs of women lead to accumulated disadvantages that have a negative impact on the right to just and favourable conditions at work and other rights. Particular attention is needed to address occupational segregation by sex and to achieve equal remuneration for work of equal value as well as equal opportunity for promotion, including through the introduction of temporary special measures. Any assessment of the ‘value’ of work must avoid gender stereotypes that could undervalue work predominantly performed by women. States parties should take into account the different requirements of male and female workers. For example, specific measures might be necessary to protect the safety and health of pregnant workers in relation to travel or night work. Day-care services in the work place and flexible working arrangements can promote equal conditions of work in practice. Workers benefiting from gender-specific measures should not be penalized in other areas. States parties must undertake measures to address traditional gender roles and other structural obstacles that perpetuate gender inequality.\r\n(ii) Young and older workers: All workers should be protected against age discrimination. Young workers should not suffer wage discrimination, for example, being forced to accept low wages that do not reflect their skills. An excessive use of unpaid internships and training programmes, as well as of short-term and fixed term contracts that negatively affect job security, career prospects and social security benefits is not in line with the right to just and favourable conditions of work. Laws and regulations should include specific measures to protect the health and safety of young workers, including through raising the minimum age for certain types of work.[38] Older workers should receive fair wages, equal remuneration for work of equal value, and have equal opportunity to promotion based on their experience and know-how.[39] Specific health and safety measures might be necessary and older workers should benefit from pre-retirement programmes, if they so wish.[40] The cumulative effects of discrimination against women workers through the life-cycle might require targeted measures to achieve equality, guarantee fair wages, equal opportunities to promotion and equal pension rights.\r\n(iii) Workers with disabilities: At times, they require specific measures to enjoy the right to just and favourable conditions of work on an equal basis with others. Workers with disabilities should not be segregated in sheltered workshops. They should benefit from an accessible work environment and must not be denied reasonable accommodation like workplace adjustments or flexible working arrangements. They should also enjoy equal remuneration for work of equal value and must not suffer wage discrimination due to a perceived reduced capacity for work.\r\n(iv) Workers in the informal economy: Though these workers account for a significant percentage of the world’s work force, they are often excluded from national statistics and legal protection, support and safeguards, exacerbating vulnerability. While the overall objective should be to formalize work, laws and policies should explicitly extend to workers in the informal economy and States parties should take steps to gather relevant disaggregated data so as to include this category of workers in the progressive realization of the right. For that purpose the informal economy should be included in the mandate of a respective monitoring and enforcement mechanism. Women are often over-represented in the informal economy, for example as casual workers, home workers or own-account workers, which in turn exacerbates inequalities in areas such as remuneration, health and safety, rest, leisure and paid leave.\r\n(v) Migrant workers: These workers, in particular if undocumented, are vulnerable to exploitation, long working hours, unfair wages and dangerous and unhealthy working environments. Such vulnerability is increased by abusive labour practices that give the employer control over the migrant worker’s residence status or which tie migrant workers to a specific employer. If they do not speak the national languages, they might be less aware of their rights and unable to access grievance mechanisms. Undocumented workers often fear reprisals from employers and eventual expulsion if they seek to complain about working conditions. Laws and policies should ensure that migrant workers enjoy treatment no less favourable than national workers in relation to remuneration and conditions of work. Internal migrant workers are also vulnerable to exploitation and require legislative and other measures to ensure their right to just and favourable conditions of work.\r\n(vi) Domestic workers: The vast majority of domestic workers are women. Many belong to ethnic or national minorities or are migrants. They are often isolated and can be exploited, harassed and in some cases subject to slave-like conditions, notably for live-in domestic workers, frequently without the right to join trade unions nor the freedom to communicate with others. Due to stereotyped perceptions, the skills required for domestic work are undervalued and, as a result, it is among the lowest paid occupations. Domestic workers have the right to just and favourable conditions of work,[41] including protection against abuse, harassment and violence, decent working conditions, paid annual leave, normal working hours as well as daily and weekly rest on the basis of equality with other workers, minimum wage coverage where this exists and remuneration established without discrimination based on sex, as well as to social security. Legislation should recognize these rights for domestic workers and ensure adequate means of monitoring domestic work, including through labour inspection, and for domestic workers to complain and seek remedies for violations.\r\n(vii) Self-employed workers: Where unable to earn a sufficient income, such workers should have access to appropriate support measures. Self-employed female workers should benefit from maternity insurance on an equal basis with other workers.[42] Legislation on occupational health and safety should cover self-employed workers, requiring them to undertake appropriate training programmes, and seek to raise their awareness on the importance of rest, leisure and limitations on working time. Small-scale farmers who rely on unpaid family labour to compensate for difficult working conditions, deserve particular attention.  \r\n(viii) Agricultural workers: Agricultural workers often face severe socio-economic disadvantages, forced labour, income insecurity and lack of access to basic services. At times they are formally excluded from industrial relations and social security systems. Women agricultural workers, particularly in family farms, are often not recognized as workers and therefore not entitled to wages and social protection, to join agricultural cooperatives and to benefit from loans, credits and other measures to improve working conditions. States parties should enact laws and policies to ensure that agricultural workers enjoy treatment no less favourable than other categories of workers.\r\n(ix) Refugee workers: Because of their often precarious status, they remain vulnerable to exploitation, discrimination and abuse in the work place, may be less well paid than nationals, have longer working hours and more dangerous working conditions. States parties should enact legislation enabling refugees to work and in conditions no less favourable than for nationals.\r\n(x) Unpaid workers: Women work in activities significant for their households and the national economy and they spend twice as much time as men in unpaid work. Unpaid workers, such as workers in the home or in family enterprises, volunteer workers and unpaid interns have remained beyond the coverage of ILO Conventions and national legislation. They have a right to just and favourable conditions of work and should be protected by laws and policies on occupational safety and health, rest and leisure, and reasonable limitations on working hours, as well as social security."
