        "Text": "The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women,\r\nTaking note that the reports, the introductory remarks and the replies by States parties reveal that while significant progress has been achieved in regard to repealing or modifying discriminatory laws, there is still a need for action to be taken to implement fully the Convention by introducing measures to promote de facto equality between men and women,\r\nRecalling article 4.1 of the Convention,\r\nRecommends that States parties make more use of temporary special measures such as positive action, preferential treatment or quota systems to advance womenâ€™s integration into education, the economy, politics and employment."
