The persistent use of such paradigms fails to acknowledge persons with disabilities as full subjects of rights and as rights holders. In addition, the Committee notes that the efforts by States parties to overcome attitudinal barriers to disability have been insufficient. Examples include enduring and humiliating stereotypes, and stigma of and prejudices against persons with disabilities as being a burden on society. In response, it is critical that persons with disabilities, through their representative organizations, play a central role in the development of legal and policy reforms."

Nevertheless, laws and regulatory frameworks often remain imperfect and incomplete or ineffective, or reflect an inadequate understanding of the human rights model of disability. Many national laws and policies perpetuate the exclusion and isolation of and discrimination and violence against persons with disabilities. They often lack a recognition of multiple and intersectional discrimination or discrimination by association; fail to acknowledge that the denial of reasonable accommodation constitutes discrimination; and lack effective mechanisms of legal redress and reparation. Such laws and policies are commonly not regarded as disability-based discrimination because they are justified as being for the protection or care of the persons with a disability, or in their best interest."

Under these models, discriminatory or differential treatment against and the exclusion of persons with disabilities is seen as the norm and is legitimized by a medically driven incapacity approach to disability. Individual or medical models were used to determine the earliest international laws and policies relating to disability, even after the first attempts to apply the concept of equality to the context of disability. The Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons (1971) and the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons (1975) were the first human rights instruments that contained equality and non-discrimination provisions for persons with disabilities. While these early soft-law human rights instruments paved the way for an equality approach to disability, they were still based on the medical model of disability, as impairment was seen as a legitimate ground for restricting or denying rights. They also include language that is now considered inappropriate or obsolete. A further step was taken in 1993 with the adoption of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities, which proclaimed “equality of opportunities” a fundamental concept of disability policy and law."

It may help to combat negative stereotyping and prejudices, but it cannot offer solutions for the “dilemma of difference”, as it does not consider and embrace differences among human beings.

Persons with disabilities have the right to be effectively protected and to positively engage. The law itself shall guarantee the substantive equality of all those within a given jurisdiction. Thus, the recognition that all persons with disabilities are equal under the law means that there should be no laws that allow for specific denial, restriction or limitation of the rights of persons with disabilities, and that disability should be mainstreamed in all legislation and policies."

The obligations to prohibit all discrimination on the basis of disability includes persons with disabilities and their associates, e.g. parents of children with disabilities. The obligation to guarantee to persons with disabilities equal and effective legal protection against discrimination on all grounds is far-reaching and imposes positive duties of protection on States parties. Disability-based discrimination is defined in article 2 as “any distinction, exclusion or restriction on the basis of disability which has the purpose or effect of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal basis with others, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field. It includes all forms of discrimination, including denial of reasonable accommodation.” That definition is based on legal definitions of discrimination in international human rights treaties, such as article 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and article 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It goes beyond those definitions in two aspects: first, it includes “denial of reasonable accommodation” as a form of disability-based discrimination; second, the phrase “on an equal basis with others” is a new component. In its articles 1 and 3, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women contains a similar but more limited phrase: “on a basis of equality of men and women”. The phrase “on an equal basis with others” is not only limited to the definition of disability-based discrimination but also permeates the whole Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. On the one hand, it means that persons with disabilities will not be granted more or fewer rights or benefits than the general population. On the other hand, it requires that States parties take concrete specific measures to achieve de facto equality for persons with disabilities to ensure that they can in fact enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms."

        "Text": "The duty to prohibit “all discrimination” includes all forms of discrimination. International human rights practice identifies four main forms of discrimination, which can occur individually or simultaneously:\n(a)“Direct discrimination” occurs when, in a similar situation, persons with disabilities are treated less favourably than other persons because of a different personal status in a similar situation for a reason related to a prohibited ground. Direct discrimination includes detrimental acts or omissions based on prohibited grounds where there is no comparable similar situation. The motive or intention of the discriminating party is not relevant to a determination of whether discrimination has occurred. For example, a State school that refuses to admit a child with disabilities in order not to change the scholastic programmes does so just because of his or her disability and is an example of direct discrimination;\n(b)“Indirect discrimination” means that laws, policies or practices appear neutral at face value but have a disproportionate negative impact on a person with a disability. It occurs when an opportunity that appears accessible in reality excludes certain persons owing to the fact that their status does not allow them to benefit from the opportunity itself. For example, if a school does not provide books in Easy-Read format, it would indirectly discriminate against persons with intellectual disabilities, who, although technically allowed to attend the school, would in fact need to attend another. Similarly, if a candidate with restricted mobility had a job interview on a second floor office in a building without an elevator, although allowed to sit the interview, the situation puts him/her in an unequal position;\n(c)“Denial of reasonable accommodation”, according to article 2 of the Convention, constitutes discrimination if the necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments (that do not impose a “disproportionate or undue burden”) are denied and are needed to ensure the equal enjoyment or exercise of a human right or fundamental freedom. Not accepting an accompanying person or refusing to otherwise accommodate a person with a disability are examples of denial of reasonable accommodation;\n(d)“Harassment” is a form of discrimination when unwanted conduct related to disability or other prohibited grounds takes place with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. It can happen through actions or words that have the effect of perpetuating the difference and oppression of persons with disabilities. Particular attention should be paid to persons with disabilities living in segregated places, such as residential institutions, special schools or psychiatric hospitals, where this type of discrimination is more likely to occur and is by nature invisible, and so not likely to be punished. “Bullying” and its online form, cyberbullying and cyberhate, also constitute particularly violent and harmful forms of hate crimes. Other examples include (disability-based) violence in all its appearances, such as rape, abuse and exploitation, hate-crime and beatings."

        "Text": "Discrimination can be based on a single characteristic, such as disability or gender, or on multiple and/or intersecting characteristics. “Intersectional discrimination” occurs when a person with a disability or associated to disability suffers discrimination of any form on the basis of disability, combined with, colour, sex, language, religion, ethnic, gender or other status. Intersectional discrimination can appear as direct or indirect discrimination, denial of reasonable accommodation or harassment. For example, while the denial of access to general health-related information due to inaccessible format affects all persons on the basis of disability, the denial to a blind woman of access to family planning services restricts her rights based on the intersection of her gender and disability. In many cases, it is difficult to separate these grounds. States parties must address multiple and intersectional discrimination against persons with disabilities. “Multiple discrimination” according to the Committee is a situation where a person can experience discrimination on two or several grounds, in the sense that discrimination is compounded or aggravated. Intersectional discrimination refers to a situation where several grounds operate and interact with each other at the same time in such a way that they are inseparable and thereby expose relevant individuals to unique types of disadvantage and discrimination."

States parties must set accessibility standards that are developed and adopted in consultation with organizations of persons with disabilities, consistent with article 4 (3) of the Convention. The duty of accessibility is a proactive, systemic duty;\n(b)As an ex nunc duty, reasonable accommodation must be provided from the moment that a person with a disability requires access to non-accessible situations or environments, or wants to exercise his or her rights. Reasonable accommodation is often but not necessarily requested by the person who requires access, or by relevant representatives of a person or a group of people. Reasonable accommodation must be negotiated with the applicant(s). In certain circumstances, the reasonable accommodation provided becomes a collective or public good. In other cases, the reasonable accommodations provided only benefit the applicant(s). The duty to provide reasonable accommodation is an individualized reactive duty that is applicable from the moment a request for accommodation is received. Reasonable accommodation requires the duty bearer to enter into dialogue with the individual with a disability. It is important to note that the duty to provide reasonable accommodation is not limited to situations in which the person with a disability has asked for an accommodation or in which it could be proved that the alleged duty bearer was actually aware that the person in question had a disability. It should also apply in situations where a potential duty bearer should have realized that the person in question had a disability that might require accommodations to address barriers to exercising rights."

        "Text": "The duty to provide reasonable accommodation in accordance with articles 2 and 5 of the Convention can be broken down into two constituent parts. The first part imposes a positive legal obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation which is a modification or adjustment that is necessary and appropriate where it is required in a particular case to ensure that a person with a disability can enjoy or exercise her or his rights. The second part of this duty ensures that those required accommodations do not impose a disproportionate or undue burden on the duty bearer.\n(a)“Reasonable accommodation” is a single term, and “reasonable” should not be misunderstood as an exception clause; the concept of “reasonableness” should not act as a distinct qualifier or modifier to the duty. It is not a means by which the costs of accommodation or the availability of resources can be assessed — this occurs at a later stage, when the “disproportionate or undue burden” assessment is undertaken. Rather, the reasonableness of an accommodation is a reference to its relevance, appropriateness and effectiveness for the person with a disability. An accommodation is reasonable, therefore, if it achieves the purpose (or purposes) for which it is being made, and is tailored to meet the requirements of the person with a disability;\n(b)“Disproportionate or undue burden” should be understood as a single concept that sets the limit of the duty to provide reasonable accommodation. Both terms should be considered synonyms insofar as they refer to the same idea: that the request for reasonable accommodation needs to be bound by a possible excessive or unjustifiable burden on the accommodating party;\n(c)“Reasonable accommodation” should also not be confused with “specific measures”, including “affirmative action measures”. While both concepts aim at achieving de facto equality, reasonable accommodation is a non-discrimination duty, whereas specific measures imply a preferential treatment of persons with disabilities over others to address historic and/or systematic/systemic exclusion from the benefits of exercising rights. Examples of specific measures include temporary measures for countering the low numbers of women with disabilities employed in the private sector and support programmes to increase the number of students with disabilities in tertiary education. Similarly, reasonable accommodation should not be confused with the provision of support, such as personal assistants, under the right to live independently and be included in the community, or support to exercise legal capacity;\n(d)“Procedural accommodations” in the context of access to justice should not be confused with reasonable accommodation; while the latter is limited by the concept of disproportionality, procedural accommodations are not."

They are often closely linked to denial or restriction of legal capacity. States parties should aim to:\n(a)Reform laws, policies and regulations that systematically exclude persons with disabilities from voting and/or standing as candidates in elections;\n(b)Ensure that the electoral process is accessible to all persons with disabilities, including before, during and after elections;\n(c)Provide reasonable accommodation to individual persons with disabilities and support measures based on the individual requirements of persons with disabilities to participate in political and public life;\n(d)Support and engage with representative organizations of persons with disabilities in political participation process at the national, regional and international levels, including by consulting with such organizations in matters that concern persons with disabilities directly;\n(e)Create information systems and legislation that allow for the continuous political participation of persons with disabilities, including between elections."

        "Text": "Data collection and analysis are essential measures to monitor anti-discrimination policies and laws. States parties should collect and analyse data, which must be disaggregated on the basis of disability and of intersectional categories. Data collected should provide information on all forms of discrimination. The data collected should be broad and cover statistics, narratives and other forms of data, such as indicators to assess the implementation and monitor the progress and effectiveness of new or ongoing initiatives and policies. Disability-inclusive indicators must be developed and used in a manner consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The design, collection and analysis of data should be participatory, i.e., undertaken in close and meaningful consultation with representative organizations of persons with disabilities, including children. People living in closed places, such as institutions or psychiatric hospitals, are often overlooked by research and studies collecting data, and should be systematically included in such studies."

        "Text": "In the light of the normative content and obligations outlined above, States parties should take the following steps to ensure the full implementation of article 5 of the Convention:\n(a)Carry out studies on harmonizing national legislation and practices with the Convention, repeal discriminatory laws and regulations that are inconsistent with the Convention and change or abolish customs and practices that are discriminatory against persons with disabilities;\n(b)Develop anti-discrimination laws where they do not exist and enact disability-inclusive anti-discrimination laws that have a broad personal and material scope and provide effective legal remedies. Such laws can only be effective if they are based on a definition of disability that includes those who have long-term physical, including psychosocial, intellectual or sensory impairments, and should include past, present, future and presumed disabilities, as well as persons associated with persons with disabilities. Persons victimized by disability-based discrimination seeking legal redress should not be burdened by proving that they are “disabled enough” in order to benefit from the protection of the law. Anti-discrimination law that is disability-inclusive seeks to outlaw and prevent a discriminatory act rather than target a defined protected group. In that regard, a broad impairment-related definition of disability is in line with the Convention;\n(c)Ensure that non-discrimination legislation extends to the private and public spheres, covers areas including education, employment, goods and services, and tackles disability-specific discrimination, such as segregated education, institutionalization, denial or restriction of legal capacity, forced mental health treatment, denial of the provision of sign language instructions and professional sign language interpretation, and denial of Braille or other alternative and augmentative modes, means and formats of communication;\n(d)Promote the full inclusion of mainstream employment and vocational training services, including those that promote entrepreneurship and support the establishment of cooperatives and other forms of social economy;\n(e)Ensure that the protection from discrimination for persons with disabilities has the same standard as for other social groups;\n(f)Develop and carry out knowledge and capacity-building programmes, including training within public authorities and the informal economy, to ensure compliance with the Convention. Awareness and capacity-building should be developed and implemented with the meaningful participation of persons with disabilities and organizations representing the diverse range of persons with disabilities, and are crucial components for establishing a culture of tolerance and diversity, which is the bedrock for anti-discrimination law and policy;\n(g)Monitor the number of discrimination claims on the basis of disability as a proportion of the total number of claims of discrimination, disaggregated by sex, age, barriers identified and the sector in which the alleged discrimination occurred, and provide information about cases that are settled out of court, in court and adjudicated, and the number of judgments that lead to compensation or sanctions;\n(h)Establish accessible and effective redress mechanisms and ensure access to justice, on an equal basis with others, for victims of discrimination based on disability. This encompasses access by all persons with disabilities to effective judicial and/or administrative procedures, including effective and accessible complaint mechanisms, and to appropriate and — where applicable and subject to statutory test of means and merits — affordable quality legal aid. States parties should intervene in an effective and timely manner in the event of actions or omissions of public and private actors that violate the right to equality and non-discrimination of individual persons with disabilities and groups of persons with disabilities, both in relation to civil and political rights as well as economic, social and cultural rights. The recognition of judicial remedies of a collective nature or class actions can significantly contribute to effectively guaranteeing access to justice in situations that affect groups of persons with disabilities;\n(i)Include in national anti-discrimination law the protection of individuals from adverse treatment or adverse consequences as a reaction to complaints or to proceedings aimed at enforcing compliance with equality provisions. Anti-discrimination legislation should also ensure that victims of discrimination are not unduly inhibited in obtaining redress or re-victimized. In particular, procedural rules should shift the burden of proof in civil procedures from the claimant to the respondent in cases where there are facts from which it may be presumed that there has been discrimination;\n(j)Develop in close consultation with organizations of persons with disabilities, national human rights institutions and other relevant stakeholders, such as equality bodies, an equality policy and strategy that is inclusive and accessible to all persons with disabilities;\n(k)Increase knowledge in all parts of society, including among State officials of all branches of government and within the private sector, about the scope, content and practical consequences of the rights to non-discrimination and equality of all persons with disabilities;\n(l)Adopt appropriate measures to monitor inclusive equality regularly and comprehensively. This includes collecting and analysing disaggregated data on the situation of persons with disabilities;\n(m)Ensure that national monitoring mechanisms under article 33 of the Convention are independent, involve representative organizations of persons with disabilities effectively and are adequately resourced to address discrimination against persons with disabilities;\n(n)Provide specific protections against and exercise due diligence to prevent and redress incidents of violence, exploitation and abuse and violations of bodily integrity experienced uniquely or disproportionately by persons with disabilities;\n(o)Adopt specific measures with a view to achieving inclusive equality, in particular for persons with disabilities who experience intersectional discrimination, such as women, girls, children, older persons, and indigenous persons with disabilities;\n(p)States parties that receive a high number of asylum seekers, refugees or migrants should put in place formal, legally defined procedures to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities, including women and children with disabilities and persons with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities, in reception facilities and other settings. States parties must ensure that psychosocial and legal counselling, support and rehabilitation is provided for persons with disabilities and that protection services are disability-, age- and gender-sensitive and culturally appropriate."
