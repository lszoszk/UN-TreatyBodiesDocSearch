Consequently, and in line with article 5 (2) of the Convention, States parties must guarantee to persons with disabilities equal and effective legal protection against discrimination on all grounds. In its recent jurisprudence, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has made reference to reasonable accommodation in connection to women with disabilities’ access to employment. The duty to provide reasonable accommodation is an ex nunc duty, meaning that it is enforceable from the moment a person requests it in a given situation in order to enjoy his or her rights on an equal basis in a particular context. Failure to provide reasonable accommodation for women with disabilities may amount to discrimination under articles 5 and 6. An example of reasonable accommodation could be an accessible facility in the workplace that would allow a woman with a disability to breastfeed."

        "Text": "Discrimination against women and girls with disabilities can take many forms: (a) direct discrimination; (b) indirect discrimination; (c) discrimination by association; (d) denial of reasonable accommodation; and (e) structural, or systemic, discrimination. Irrespective of the form it takes, the impact of discrimination violates the rights of women with disabilities:\n(a)Direct discrimination occurs when women with disabilities are treated less favourably than another person in a similar situation for a reason related to a prohibited ground. It also includes detrimental acts or omissions on the basis of prohibited grounds where there is no comparable similar situation. For example, direct discrimination occurs when the testimonies of women with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities are dismissed in court proceedings because of legal capacity, thus denying those women justice and effective remedies as victims of violence;\n(b)Indirect discrimination refers to laws, policies or practices that appear neutral when taken at face value but that nonetheless have a disproportionately negative impact on women with disabilities. For example, health-care facilities may appear neutral but are discriminatory when they do not include accessible examination beds for gynaecological screenings;\n(c)Discrimination by association is discrimination against persons on the basis of their association with a person with a disability. Often, women in a caregiver role experience discrimination by association. For example, the mother of a child with a disability may be discriminated against by a potential employer who fears that she may be a less engaged or available worker because of her child;\n(d)Denial of reasonable accommodation is discrimination that occurs when necessary and appropriate modifications and adjustments (that do not impose a disproportionate or undue burden) are denied despite being needed to ensure that women with disabilities enjoy, on an equal basis with others, their human rights and fundamental freedoms. For example, a woman with a disability may be denied reasonable accommodation if she cannot undergo a mammogram at a health centre owing to the physical inaccessibility of the built environment;\n(e)Structural, or systemic, discrimination is reflected in hidden or overt patterns of discriminatory institutional behaviour, discriminatory cultural traditions and discriminatory social norms and/or rules. Harmful gender and disability stereotyping, which can lead to such discrimination, is inextricably linked to a lack of policies, regulations and services specifically for women with disabilities. For example, owing to stereotyping based on the intersection of gender and disability, women with disabilities may face barriers when reporting violence, such as disbelief and dismissal by the police, prosecutors and courts. Likewise, harmful practices are strongly connected to and reinforce socially constructed gender roles and power relations that can reflect negative perceptions of, or discriminatory beliefs regarding, women with disabilities, such as the belief that men with HIV/AIDS can be cured by engaging in sexual intercourse with women with disabilities. The lack of awareness, training and policies to prevent harmful stereotyping of women with disabilities by public officials, be they teachers, health service providers, police officers, prosecutors or judges, and by the public at large can often lead to the violation of rights."

Other examples of harmful practices include infanticide, accusations of “spirit possession” and restrictions in feeding and nutrition. In addition, the marriage of girls with disabilities, especially girls with intellectual disabilities, is justified under the pretext of providing future security, care and financing. In turn, child marriage contributes to higher rates of dropping out of school and to early and frequent childbirth. Girls with disabilities experience social isolation, segregation and exploitation inside the family, including by being excluded from family activities, prevented from leaving home, forced to perform unpaid housework and being forbidden from attending school."

They reinforce harmful gender stereotypes, perpetuate inequalities and contribute to discrimination against women and girls.

Harmful practices based on patriarchal interpretations of culture cannot be evoked to justify violence against women and girls with disabilities.

Gender and/or disability stereotyping is the practice of ascribing to a specific individual a stereotypical belief; it is wrongful when it results in a violation or in violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. An example of this is the failure of the justice system to hold the perpetrator of sexual violence against a woman with disability accountable based on stereotypical views about the women’s sexuality or her credibility as a witness."

Although women and children are prioritized in the distribution of humanitarian relief, women with disabilities cannot always obtain information on relief projects, as that information is often not available in accessible formats. When women with disabilities do receive information, they may not be able to physically access distribution points. Even when they do, they may not be able to communicate with staff. Likewise, if women with disabilities are subjected to violence, exploitation or abuse, information and communication helplines and hotlines may not be accessible. Refugee camps often lack child protection mechanisms for children with disabilities. In addition, accessible sanitation facilities to ensure hygienic menstrual management are often unavailable, which can in turn increase women with disabilities’ exposure to violence. Single women with disabilities face barriers to accessible evacuation as a result of an emergency or disaster situation, in particular if they are accompanied by their children at the time of evacuation. This disproportionately affects internally displaced women with disabilities who are without an adult family member, friends or caregivers. Displaced girls with disabilities face additional barriers in accessing formal and non-formal education, especially in crisis settings."

Violence against women with disabilities in institutions includes: involuntary undressing by male staff against the will of the woman concerned; forced administration of psychiatric medication; and overmedication, which can reduce the ability to describe and/or remember sexual violence.
