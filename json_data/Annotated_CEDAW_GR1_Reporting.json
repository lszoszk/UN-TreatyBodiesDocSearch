        "Text": "The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women,\r\nBearing in mind that the Committee had been faced with difficulties in its work because some initial reports of States parties under article 18 of the Convention did not reflect adequately the information available in the State party concerned in accordance with the guidelines,\r\nRecommends:\r\n(a) That the States parties, in preparing reports under article 18 of the Convention,\r\nshould follow the general guidelines adopted in August 1983 (CEDAW/C/7) as to the form, content and date of reports;\r\n(b) That the States parties should follow the general recommendation adopted in 1986 in these terms:\r\n“Initial reports submitted under article 18 of the Convention should cover the situation up to the date of submission. Thereafter, reports should be submitted at least every four years after the first report was due and should include obstacles encountered in implementing the Convention fully and the measures adopted to overcome such obstacles.”\r\n(c) That additional information supplementing the report of a State party should be sent to the Secretariat at least three months before the session at which the report is due to be considered."
