It has become in many cases a mechanism for the mass arbitrary imprisonment of migrants and their families. The Committee has witnessed with concern over the last decades a rising involvement and influence of private prison corporations in immigration enforcement, alongside the expansion of the immigration detention system. Immigration detention has become an industry, reporting sizeable annual profits to private prison contractors, and in some cases States, Profits are drawn from detaining migrants and asylum seekers, including those awaiting a decision on their applications as well as migrants in the process of being deported. The Committee notes with extreme concern that immigration detention disproportionately affects poor migrants and people of colour, who at the same time have the greatest difficulties in defending themselves or obtaining legal assistance in immigration, asylum or international protection procedures."

Detention aggravates existing health conditions and causes new ones to arise, including the onset of anxiety, depression, exclusion and post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, worsening their condition of vulnerability, and in some cases including suicide. Those negative effects are the result of various factors, including the indeterminate duration of detention, the arbitrariness and uncertainty surrounding it, family separation, overcrowding, a lack of access to food, safe water and medical care, deliberate physical and psychological abuse by State officials, private guards or other detainees, prolonged detention in solitary confinement, and lack of access to nationality or the enjoyment of nationality rights. Such abuse includes torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment, sexual violence, disappearances, extortion and human trafficking for the purpose of exploitation, including, at a minimum, exploitation of prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery or servitude, or the removal of organs."

The Committee notes with concern that in different regions of the world, countries use different terms to refer to deprivation of liberty for immigration reasons or immigration detention, such as “filing and accommodation”, “processing”, “reception”, “retention” and “placement”.

Such deprivation of liberty begins at the time of arrest and extends until the person is released. Irrespective of how that measure is defined in the national policy, law or practice or the reasons giving rise to it, if the measure results in a deprivation of liberty in which migrants or their families are unable to leave at will, the Committee understands the measure to be a form of detention to which articles 16 and 17 of the Convention apply."

The Committee agrees with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that “detention based solely on migration-status, as such, can also amount to torture, most notably where it is being intentionally imposed or perpetuated for purposes such as deterring, intimidating, or punishing irregular migrants or their families, coercing them into withdrawing their requests for asylum, subsidiary protection or other stay, agreeing to voluntary repatriation, providing information or fingerprints, or with a view to extorting money or sexual acts, or for reasons based on discrimination of any kind, including discrimination based on migration status”"

The Committee opposes the treatment of migration by States that frame it as a threat to local communities and the consequent adoption of national laws, policies or practices that designate migrants as “dangerous” or “harmful” persons or even “criminals”. Such practices only aggravate migrants’ vulnerability and make them more likely to become victims of discrimination, xenophobia, violence, trafficking and other human rights violations. The Committee notes with concern that one of the consequences of the criminalization of migration is the increasing association, both in legal documents and in public opinion, of migrants in an irregular situation with criminals."

Migration irregularity is not the result of a decision of the migrant, but of restrictive policies of the State that prevent the exercise of the right to freedom of movement. Criminalizing irregular entry into a country exceeds the legitimate interest of States to control and regulate irregular migration and leads to unnecessary detention. States should refrain from using armed forces or any similar security forces to detain migrants as a means of implementing an immigration policy."

The Committee notes that the indiscriminate use of immigration detention as a mechanism to deter migration or to combat irregular migration is ineffective in achieving those ends. It is economically more onerous than the regular migration pathway and violates multiple rights of migrants."

Detention of children is thus always prohibited under international human rights law because it is unnecessary and disproportionate. It constitutes a child rights violation and contravenes the principles of non-discrimination, best interests of the child, right to life, survival and development, and participation, as well as every child’s right to liberty and family life."

That includes pregnant and breastfeeding women, older persons, persons with disabilities, survivors of torture or trauma, persons who are victims of crimes such as trafficking, migrants with special physical or mental health needs, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, refugees, asylum seekers and stateless persons. Statelessness determination procedures are essential, given that the lack of a country of nationality to be returned to leaves stateless persons at higher risk of arbitrary and indefinite detention.

Alternatives to detention must respect the right to personal freedom and thus not create onerous restrictions or conditions, but rather generate other legitimate mechanisms and measures that are in line with human rights standards. In cases where detention no longer has a legal basis – for example when deportation, expulsion or removal is no longer a viable objective – alternatives to detention are no longer applicable."

Evidence suggests that when properly implemented, these measures can be more effective than detention in assisting people to cope better with immigration procedures, including in cases where migrants’ cases are rejected and they are asked to return voluntarily and independently. Alternative measures to detention can also be significantly less costly than detention given their lower operating costs.

Such safeguards include ensuring that the alternative measure is established by law, limited in duration, not discriminatory in its purpose and effect, not arbitrary, subject to procedural safeguards, including regular judicial review and independent supervision, and that they protect the rights and dignity of the individual. Officials should review the effects of the alternative measures on the rights of migrants and verify that no unnecessary restrictions are imposed on migrants, in order to identify the least invasive alternative measure to detention."

Similarly, the exercise of rights by migrants deprived of their liberty cannot be grounds for prolonging detention. Any deprivation of liberty implemented on the grounds that detainees are exercising their rights to access to justice or due process guarantees or to apply for asylum or international protection would therefore be arbitrary. Finally, detaining stateless persons when there is not a real prospect of removal will potentially render the detention arbitrary and the detained stateless person must be immediately released."

Women, children, persons with disabilities and members of the LGBTI+ community are highly vulnerable to abuse in immigration detention centres. In some cases, the abuse amounts to torture. The Committee notes that migrants are at an increased risk of human rights violations while in detention, and States have an ex-officio obligation to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish any acts of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or other human rights violations by detention facility personnel, detainees or any other person."

States should establish mechanisms to identify victims of trafficking and abuse by traffickers, and provide victims with protection and assistance. Furthermore, States should conduct prompt, effective and impartial investigations into all cases of trafficking and abuse by traffickers and prosecute and punish the perpetrators of such acts and their accomplices, including in the case of public officials.

The Committee recalls its joint guidance note on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the human rights of migrants and the joint guidance note on equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all migrants and urges States to fully implement their recommendations, paying special attention to integrate migrant workers into national COVID-19 prevention and response plans and policies, which are gender, age and diversity responsive, and respect their right to health, including by ensuring that the provision of tests, essential medicines, prevention measures, treatment and vaccines are provided in a non-discriminatory manner, and provide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccination for all migrants and their families on a non-discriminatory basis, regardless of their nationality, migration status, or situation of statelessness."

It is therefore important that States set clear criteria and establish an inventory of retained belongings. It is also necessary to ensure access to their belongings whenever necessary, that indispensable belongings are not withheld and that belongings that are withheld do not include essential items, such as medicines, devices needed by persons with complex communication or mobility requirements, telephone numbers of close relations and identity documents. For all other belongings, custody must be supervised, and it must be ensured that they are returned to the migrant at the end of detention.
