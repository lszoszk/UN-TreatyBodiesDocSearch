The adoption of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994 further highlighted reproductive and sexual health issues within the human rights framework. Since then, international and regional human rights standards and jurisprudence related to the right to sexual and reproductive health have considerably evolved. Most recently, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes goals and targets to be achieved in the area of sexual and reproductive health."

Poverty, income inequality, systemic discrimination and marginalization based on grounds identified by the Committee are all social determinants of sexual and reproductive health, which also have an impact on the enjoyment of an array of other rights as well. The nature of these social determinants, which are often expressed in laws and policies, limits the choices that individuals can exercise with respect to their sexual and reproductive health.
