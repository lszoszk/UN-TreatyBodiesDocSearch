At the same time, the risks – and the unequal distribution of these benefits and risks – have prompted a rich and growing discussion on the relationship between science and economic, social and cultural rights. Several important documents have been issued on this subject, such as the Venice Statement on the Right to Enjoy the Benefits of Scientific Progress and its Applications, adopted in 2009, the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2005, the Recommendation on Science and Scientific Researchers, adopted by UNESCO in 2017, the report of the Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights on the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications (A/HRC/20/26) and the Committee’s general comment No. 17 (2005) on the right of everyone to benefit from the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he or she is the author. Indeed, UNESCO, declarations made at international conferences and summits, [1] the Special Rapporteur on cultural rights, and eminent scientific organizations and publications [2] have upheld the “human right to science”, referring to all the rights, entitlements and obligations related to science."

Thus, the right of everyone to take part in cultural life includes the right of every person to take part in scientific progress and in decisions concerning its direction. This interpretation is also implied by the principles of participation and inclusiveness underlying the Covenant and by the expression, “to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress”. Such benefits are not restricted to the material benefits or products of scientific advancement, but include the development of the critical mind and faculties associated with doing science. This understanding is corroborated by the travaux préparatoires on the drafting of article 15 of the Covenant, which demonstrate that the article was intended to develop article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,5 which recognizes not only a right to benefit from the applications of science but also to participate in scientific advancement.6 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is relevant to establish the scope of all the rights enshrined in the Covenant, not only because the preamble to the Covenant refers explicitly to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but also because both instruments represent international endeavours to give legal force to the rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights through the adoption of binding treaties. Thus, doing science does not only concern scientific professionals but also includes “citizen science” (ordinary people doing science) and the dissemination of scientific knowledge.

Patents give patent holders a temporary exclusive right to exploit the product or service they have invented. Thus, they can determine a price for these products and services.

States should also take measures in cooperation with other States against biopiracy and against illicit trafficking of organs, tissues, samples, genetic resources and genetic-related materials. [29]"

        "Text": "Pandemics are a crucial example of the need for scientific international cooperation to face transnational threats. Viruses and other pathogens do not respect borders. If adequate measures are not taken, a local epidemic can very quickly become a pandemic with devastating consequences. The role of the World Health Organization in this field remains fundamental and should be supported. Combating pandemics effectively requires stronger commitment from States to scientific international cooperation, as national solutions are insufficient. Enhanced international cooperation could increase the preparedness of States and of international organizations to face future pandemics, for instance by sharing scientific information about potential pathogens. It should also improve early warning mechanisms, based on timely and transparent information provided by States on emerging epidemics that have the potential to transform into a pandemic, which would allow early interventions, based on the best scientific evidence, aimed at controlling the epidemics and preventing them from becoming a pandemic. If a pandemic develops, sharing the best scientific knowledge and its applications, especially in the medical field, becomes crucial to mitigate the impact of the disease and to expedite the discovery of effective treatments and vaccines. After the pandemic is over, scientific research should be promoted to learn lessons and increase preparedness for possible pandemics in the future."

        "Text": "States also have extraterritorial obligations with regard to the full realization of the right to participate in and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications. In particular, States parties, when negotiating international agreements or adopting their domestic intellectual property regime, should ensure that traditional knowledge is protected, contributions to scientific knowledge are appropriately credited and that intellectual property regimes foster the enjoyment of this right. 30 These bilateral and multilateral agreements should enable developing countries to build their capacity to participate in generating and sharing scientific knowledge and benefiting from its applications. The Committee recalls that States parties participating in decisions as members of international organizations cannot ignore their human rights obligations (see E/C.12/2016/1). Thus, States parties should direct their efforts and exercise their voting powers in these organizations towards ensuring respect, protection and fulfilment of the right to participate in and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications."

This framework should include, inter alia, the protection of access, without discrimination, to the benefits of scientific progress, especially when other economic, social and cultural rights are at stake for those most in need; the protection of freedom of research with limits compatible with article 4 of the Covenant; measures to ensure that ethics and human rights are respected in scientific research, including the establishment of committees on ethics when necessary; measures to harmonize intellectual property with the right to participate in and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications; and adequate protection against all forms of discrimination."

Such a plan will help ensure that various scientific endeavours are not carried out in a fragmented and uncoordinated manner, but are part of an integrated effort for the promotion, the conservation and the diffusion of science. This plan of action should include, inter alia: measures to facilitate access without discrimination to the applications of scientific progress, especially when these applications are needed for the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights; measures to strengthen human and institutional scientific capacities in the State; adequate public funding, especially for research that is relevant to meet the needs of the population and for the promotion of access to scientific education, particularly for groups that traditionally face discrimination in this field; mechanisms to promote a culture of scientific inquiry, public trust and support for sciences in society, particularly through a vigorous and informed democratic debate on the production and use of scientific knowledge, and a dialogue between the scientific community and society; mechanisms to protect the population from false, misleading and pseudoscience-based practices, especially when other economic, social and cultural rights are at risk; measures to ensure ethics in science, such as the establishment or promotion of independent, multidisciplinary and pluralist ethics committees to assess the relevant ethical, legal, scientific and social issues related to research projects; and measures to enhance the professional and material conditions of scientific researchers.
