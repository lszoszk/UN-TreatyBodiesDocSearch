There are an estimated 476.6 million Indigenous Peoples globally, of whom more than half (238.4 million) are women. Discrimination and violence are recurrent phenomena in the lives of many Indigenous women and girls living in rural, remote and urban areas.

It identifies and addresses different forms of intersectional discrimination faced by Indigenous women and girls and their key role as leaders, knowledge-bearers and transmitters of culture among their peoples, communities and families, as well as society as a whole. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has consistently identified patterns of discrimination faced by Indigenous women and girls in the exercise of their human rights, and the factors that continue to exacerbate discrimination against them. Such discrimination is often intersectional and based on factors such as sex; gender; Indigenous origin, status or identity; race; ethnicity; disability; age; language; socioeconomic status; and HIV/AIDS status. "

Indigenous women and girls often have an inextricable link and relation to their peoples, lands, territories, natural resources and culture. To ensure compliance with articles 1 and 2 and other relevant provisions of the Convention, State action, legislation and policies must reflect and respect the multifaceted identity of Indigenous women and girls.

A gender perspective takes into consideration the discriminatory norms, harmful social practices, stereotypes and inferior treatment that have affected Indigenous women and girls historically and still affect them in the present. An intersectional perspective requires States to consider the multitude of factors that combine to increase the exposure of Indigenous women and girls to, and exacerbate the consequences of, unequal and arbitrary treatment on the basis of sex; gender; Indigenous origin, status or identity; race; ethnicity; disability; age; language; socioeconomic status; and HIV/AIDS status, among other factors. States should take into consideration the interdependence and interconnectedness of all these factors in their adoption of laws, policies, national budgets and interventions related to Indigenous women and girls. Indigenous women and girls suffer intersectional discrimination both inside and outside their territories. Intersectional discrimination against them is structural, embedded in constitutions, laws and policies, as well as government programmes, action and services. "

It also involves considering the status of Indigenous girls as developing women, which requires interventions to be appropriate to their age, development and condition. An intercultural perspective involves considering the diversity of Indigenous Peoples, including their cultures, languages, beliefs and values, and the social appreciation and value of this diversity. Lastly, a multidisciplinary perspective requires an appreciation of the multifaceted identity of Indigenous women and girls and of how law, health, education, culture, spirituality, anthropology, economy, science and work, among other aspects, have shaped and continue to shape the social experience of Indigenous women and girls and to promote discrimination against them. These perspectives and approaches are key to preventing and eradicating discrimination against Indigenous women and girls and to achieving the goal of social justice when their human rights are violated."

They are heavily affected by existential threats connected to climate change, environmental degradation, the loss of biodiversity and barriers in gaining access to food and water security. Extractive activities carried out by business enterprises and other industrial, financial, public and private actors often have a devastating impact on the environment, air, land, waterways, oceans, territories and natural resources of Indigenous Peoples and may infringe the rights of Indigenous women and girls. Indigenous women and girls are at the forefront of the local, national and international demand and action for a clean, safe, healthy and sustainable environment. Many Indigenous women who are environmental human rights defenders face killings, harassment, criminalization and the ongoing discrediting of their work. States parties have an obligation to ensure that State actors and business enterprises take measures without delay to guarantee a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and planetary system, including the prevention of foreseeable loss and damage, socioeconomic and environmental violence, and all forms of violence against Indigenous women who are environmental human rights defenders and their communities and territories. States parties also have an obligation to address the effects of colonialism, racism, assimilation policies, sexism, poverty, armed conflicts, militarization, forced displacement and the loss of territories, sexual violence as a tool of war, and other alarming human rights abuses frequently perpetrated against Indigenous women and girls and their communities."

Indigenous women face a lack of legal recognition of their rights to land and territories and wide gaps in the implementation of existing laws to protect their collective rights.

The underlying causes also impede the recognition and protection of and support for collective and cooperative forms of land ownership and use. Legal protections for the land rights of Indigenous women remain weak, which frequently exposes them to dispossession, displacement, confinement, expropriation and exploitation. The lack of legal title to the territories of Indigenous Peoples increases their vulnerability to illegal incursions and to the implementation of development projects without their free, prior and informed consent by both State and non-State actors. Indigenous women and girls – in particular those who are widows, heads of households or orphans – disproportionately face barriers in gaining access to land, resulting in the loss of their livelihoods and threatening their culture, their intrinsic link to their environment, their food and water security and their health. "

In many parts of the world, Indigenous women lack the capacity to conclude contracts and administer property independent of their husband or a male guardian. They also experience challenges in owning, holding, controlling, inheriting and administering land, in particular when they are widowed and have to care for their families on their own. Inheritance laws – in both the State and Indigenous legal systems – frequently discriminate against Indigenous women. Indigenous women with disabilities commonly experience the denial of legal capacity, which leads to further human rights violations, including in the areas of access to justice, institutionalized violence and forced sterilization. Contrary to article 9 of the Convention, many laws still discriminate against Indigenous women and girls in relation to the transmission of their nationality and Indigenous status to their children when they marry non-Indigenous persons. These laws can result in transgenerational discrimination and forced assimilation, which fall within the scope and meaning of discrimination against women as defined in article 1 of the Convention. Therefore, States must ensure that Indigenous women and girls can acquire, change, retain or renounce their nationality and/or Indigenous status, transfer it to their children and spouse and have access to information on these rights, as part of ensuring their rights to self-determination and self-identification. "

The key barriers to these rights are the incompatibility of national laws with international law; the ineffective implementation of laws at the national and local levels; discriminatory gender stereotypes and practices, in particular in rural areas; lack of political will; and the commercialization, commodification and financialization of land and natural resources. Indigenous customary laws, misogyny and existing institutions may also be barriers. Indigenous women with disabilities often face intersecting forms of discrimination on the basis of their sex; gender; disability; and Indigenous origin, status or identity, reflected in the denial of their full legal capacity, which further increases their risk exposure to exploitation, violence and abuse and undermines their rights to land, territories and resources. Moreover, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex Indigenous women and girls regularly face intersecting forms of discrimination.

Doing so entails having available interpreters, translators, anthropologists, psychologists, health-care professionals, lawyers, cultural mediators with experience, and Indigenous spiritual and medicinal authorities, as well as training, incorporating a gender perspective, on the realities, cultures and views of Indigenous women and girls. Justice systems should also have in place methods to collect evidence that are appropriate and compatible with their culture and views. Justice officials should be consistently trained on the rights of Indigenous women and girls and the individual and collective dimensions of their identity, with the goal of instilling in the officials a substantial degree of Indigenous cultural competence. In that regard, it is key to respect the different conceptions of justice and processes that non-Indigenous and Indigenous systems have, and to actively listen to and collaborate with Indigenous Peoples. Justice can be a process of reconciliation and healing for them, with the goal of restoring harmony to their territories and communities. States should also proactively recruit and appoint Indigenous women justices. "

The barriers that they encounter in gaining access to justice and reparations include a lack of information in Indigenous languages on the legal remedies available in both non-Indigenous and Indigenous justice systems. Other barriers include the costs of legal assistance and the lack of free legal aid; disrespect of due process guarantees; absence of interpreters, including for sign language; court fees; long distances to courts; reprisals and retribution against those who report crimes; lack of identity cards and forms of identification; and lack of training for justice officials on the rights and specific needs of Indigenous women and girls.

Social support systems should be operationally effective, accessible and culturally responsive;\r\n(b) Ensure quality education that is inclusive, accessible and affordable for all Indigenous women and girls, including those with disabilities. States should remove barriers and provide adequate resources and facilities to ensure that Indigenous women and girls with disabilities have access to an education. States should guarantee the availability of age-appropriate sexual education based on scientific research;\r\n(c) Promote the adoption of curricula that reflect Indigenous education, languages, cultures, history, knowledge systems and epistemologies . These efforts should extend to all schools, including those in the mainstream. The adoption of curricula should be done with the participation of Indigenous women and girls."

        "Text": "Indigenous women have limited access to decent, safe and adequately remunerated employment, which undermines their economic autonomy. They contribute significantly to the agricultural sector but are overrepresented in subsistence agriculture; low-skilled, part-time, seasonal, low-paid or unpaid jobs; and home-based activities. A significant number of Indigenous women and girls also engage in domestic work with low remuneration and unsafe working conditions. Their overrepresentation in informal employment translates into weak income, benefits and social protection. They also face discriminatory gender stereotypes and racial prejudice in the workplace, including frequent prohibition from wearing their attire or using their languages. Indigenous women often face forms of gender-based violence and harassment at work, and their treatment can amount to forced labour and forms of slavery. States should create equal opportunities for Indigenous women and girls to gain access to the needed education and training necessary to increase their employment prospects and to facilitate their transition from the informal to the formal economy. States should also guarantee that Indigenous Peoples and women continue to pursue and benefit from their occupations, without discrimination. "

Health professionals are often race- and gender-biased, insensitive to the realities, culture and views of Indigenous women and do not speak Indigenous languages, and they rarely offer services respecting the dignity, privacy, informed consent and reproductive autonomy of Indigenous women. Indigenous women frequently experience difficulties in securing access to sexual and reproductive health information and education, including about family planning methods, contraception and access to safe and legal abortion. They are often victims of gender-based violence in the health system, including obstetrics violence; coercive practices, such as involuntary sterilizations or forced contraception; and barriers to their ability to decide on the number and spacing of their children. Indigenous midwives and birth attendants are often criminalized, and technical knowledge is undervalued by non-Indigenous health systems.

Climate change and other forms of environmental degradation also threaten food security and contaminate and disrupt water supplies. States should adopt urgent measures to ensure that Indigenous women and girls have adequate access to sufficient food, nutrition and water. Of particular concern is the increasing commercialization of seeds, which are an essential part of the ancestral knowledge and cultural heritage of Indigenous Peoples.
