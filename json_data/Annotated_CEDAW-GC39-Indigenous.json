The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has consistently identified patterns of discrimination faced by Indigenous women and girls in the exercise of their human rights, and the factors that continue to exacerbate discrimination against them.

An intercultural perspective involves considering the diversity of Indigenous Peoples, including their cultures, languages, beliefs and values, and the social appreciation and value of this diversity.

Legal protections for the land rights of Indigenous women remain weak, which frequently exposes them to dispossession, displacement, confinement, expropriation and exploitation.

Inheritance laws – in both the State and Indigenous legal systems – frequently discriminate against Indigenous women. Indigenous women with disabilities commonly experience the denial of legal capacity, which leads to further human rights violations, including in the areas of access to justice, institutionalized violence and forced sterilization. Contrary to article 9 of the Convention, many laws still discriminate against Indigenous women and girls in relation to the transmission of their nationality and Indigenous status to their children when they marry non-Indigenous persons. These laws can result in transgenerational discrimination and forced assimilation, which fall within the scope and meaning of discrimination against women as defined in article 1 of the Convention.

Doing so entails having available interpreters, translators, anthropologists, psychologists, health-care professionals, lawyers, cultural mediators with experience, and Indigenous spiritual and medicinal authorities, as well as training, incorporating a gender perspective, on the realities, cultures and views of Indigenous women and girls. Justice systems should also have in place methods to collect evidence that are appropriate and compatible with their culture and views. Justice officials should be consistently trained on the rights of Indigenous women and girls and the individual and collective dimensions of their identity, with the goal of instilling in the officials a substantial degree of Indigenous cultural competence. In that regard, it is key to respect the different conceptions of justice and processes that non-Indigenous and Indigenous systems have, and to actively listen to and collaborate with Indigenous Peoples. Justice can be a process of reconciliation and healing for them, with the goal of restoring harmony to their territories and communities. States should also proactively recruit and appoint Indigenous women justices. ",

Indigenous women frequently experience difficulties in securing access to sexual and reproductive health information and education, including about family planning methods, contraception and access to safe and legal abortion. They are often victims of gender-based violence in the health system, including obstetrics violence; coercive practices, such as involuntary sterilizations or forced contraception; and barriers to their ability to decide on the number and spacing of their children. Indigenous midwives and birth attendants are often criminalized, and technical knowledge is undervalued by non-Indigenous health systems. Pandemics have a disproportionate impact on Indigenous women and girls, and States parties must ensure access to culturally acceptable health-care services, testing and vaccination during such emergencies. ",

Climate change and other forms of environmental degradation also threaten food security and contaminate and disrupt water supplies.
