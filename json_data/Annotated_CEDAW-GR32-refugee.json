The present general recommendation specifically addresses the application of the Convention to the right to asylum contained in article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the principle of non-refoulement of refugees and asylum seekers in accordance with existing obligations under international refugee and human rights instruments and the right to nationality contained in article 9 of the Convention and the protection against statelessness."

Discrimination against women based on sex and/or gender is often inextricably linked with and compounded by other factors that affect women, such as race, ethnicity, religion or belief, health, age, class, caste, being lesbian, bisexual or transgender and other status.3 Discrimination on the basis of sex or gender may affect women belonging to such groups to a different degree or in different ways to men. States parties must legally recognize such intersecting forms of discrimination and their compounded negative impact on the women concerned and prohibit them."

However, the criteria provided by the definition of the word “refugee” in the 1951 Convention are important for the identification of women in need of international protection. At the same time, the Committee notes that regional refugee instruments and national laws have accepted and also expanded upon the definition given in the 1951 Convention to cover a range of persons in need of international protection for reasons of, variously, international or internal/non-international armed conflict and occupation, events seriously disturbing public order, serious human rights violations or generalized violence."

Gender-related persecution is absent from the text. The present general recommendation is intended to ensure that States parties apply a gender perspective when interpreting all five grounds, use gender as a factor in recognizing membership of a particular social group for purposes of granting refugee status under the 1951 Convention and further introduce other grounds of persecution, namely sex and/or gender, into national legislation and policies relating to refugees and asylum seekers. It should be noted that, in other international, national and regional contexts, asylum is also provided to persons who cannot be returned to their countries of origin owing to, among other things, threats to their lives or torture or inhuman or degrading treatment.

It also recognizes the persistence of other forms of exploitation concomitant with displacement, such as trafficking for purposes of sexual or labour exploitation, slavery and servitude. The Committee therefore reiterates the obligation of States parties to treat women with dignity and to respect, protect and fulfil their rights under the Convention at each stage of the displacement8 cycle, as well as in the enjoyment of durable solutions, including integration and/or resettlement in receiving States and/or voluntary repatriation to their State of origin."

Such violence, just as other gender-related forms of persecution, may breach specific provisions of the Convention. Such forms are recognized as legitimate grounds for international protection in law and in practice.10 They may include the threat of female genital mutilation, forced/early marriage, threat of violence and/or so-called “honour crimes”, trafficking in women,11 acid attacks, rape and other forms of sexual assault, serious forms of domestic violence, the imposition of the death penalty or other physical punishments existing in discriminatory justice systems, forced sterilization,12 political or religious persecution for holding feminist or other views and the persecutory consequences of failing to conform to gender-prescribed social norms and mores or for claiming their rights under the Convention."

        "Text": "Gender-related claims to asylum may intersect with other proscribed grounds of discrimination, including age, race, ethnicity/nationality, religion, health, class, caste, being lesbian, bisexual or transgender and other status.13 The Committee is concerned that many asylum systems continue to treat the claims of women through the lens of male experiences, which can result in their claims to refugee status not being properly assessed or being rejected. Even though gender is not specifically referenced in the definition of a refugee given in the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, it can influence or dictate the type of persecution or harm suffered by women and the reasons for such treatment. The definition in the 1951 Convention, properly interpreted, covers gender-related claims to refugee status.14 It must be emphasized that asylum procedures that do not take into account the special situation or needs of women can impede a comprehensive determination of their claims. For example, asylum authorities may interview only the male “head of household”, may not provide same-sex interviewers and interpreters to allow women to present their claims in a safe and gender-sensitive environment or may interview women asylum seekers in the presence of their husbands or male family members who may in fact be the source or sources of their complaints."

In reply, the Committee has noted,19 among other things, that, under international human rights law, the non-refoulement principle imposes a duty on States to refrain from returning a person to a jurisdiction in which he or she may face serious violations of human rights, notably arbitrary deprivation of life or torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In addition, the Committee recalls that civil and political rights and freedoms, including the right to life and the right not to be subjected to torture or ill-treatment, are implicitly covered by the Convention, and thus States parties are under the obligation not to extradite, deport, expel or otherwise remove a person from their territory to the territory of another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of irreparable harm."

However, the Committee notes that the fact that a woman asylum seeker has not sought the protection of the State or made a complaint to the authorities before her departure from her country of origin should not prejudice her asylum claim, especially where violence against women is tolerated or there is a pattern of failure in responding to women’s complaints of abuse.

Article 5 of the Convention requires States parties to assess women’s claims to asylum without prejudices and stereotyped notions of women that are based on the inferiority or superiority of either sex. Gender stereotyping affects the right of women to a fair and just asylum process and the asylum authorities must take precautions not to create standards that are based on preconceived notions of gender-based violence and persecution.28 In addition, women are active agents who play important roles as political leaders, members of Governments or opposition groups, journalists, human rights defenders and activists, lawyers and judges, among others. They are targeted on account of their political opinions and/or activities, including the expression of women’s rights. Accordingly, article 7 of the Convention requires States parties to take action to realize equality for women in political and public life. It may therefore be appropriate that women bring claims to asylum on gender-related persecution grounds or political, religious, racial and ethnic grounds, including in situations in which they were compelled to flee their country of origin owing to external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or serious civil strife."

They should be informed of the right to and, upon request, be provided with, a female interviewer and interpreter; \r\n(c)That women asylum seekers have access to competent legal representation in advance of the initial asylum interview. Where necessary, they should be afforded legal assistance free of charge. Unaccompanied and separated girls must in all cases be assigned a qualified legal representative and a guardian to assist them through the asylum procedure and ensure respect for their best interests;\r\n(d) That interviewers use techniques and procedures that are sensitive to gender, age and other intersectional grounds of discrimination and disadvantage that compound the human rights violations that women refugees and asylum seekers experience;\r\n(e) That a supportive interview environment is established so that the claimant can provide her account, including disclosure of sensitive and personal information, especially for survivors of trauma, torture and/or ill-treatment and sexual violence, and that sufficient time is allocated for interviews;\r\n(f) That childcare is made available during the interviews so that the claimant does not have to present her claim, involving sensitive information, in front of her children;\r\n(g) That, while the woman asylum claimant normally bears the burden of proving her asylum case, the duty to ascertain and evaluate all the relevant facts is shared between the claimant and the examiner. The threshold for accepting asylum applications should be measured not against the probability but against the reasonable likelihood that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution or that she would be exposed to persecution on return; \r\n(h)That, in some cases, it may be for the examiner to use all the means at his or her disposal to produce the necessary evidence in support of the application, including by seeking and gathering gender-relevant information from reliable governmental and non-governmental sources on human rights in the country of origin;\r\n(i)That late disclosure by the claimant during the asylum procedure of sexual violence and other traumatic events does not automatically lead to an adverse judgement on her credibility. Reluctance to identify the true extent of the persecution suffered or feared may stem from feelings of shame, stigma or trauma. Statements regarding the confidential nature of interviews, including that information provided by the woman will not be shared with members of her family without her consent, should be standard practice;\r\n(j) That mechanisms for referral to psychosocial counselling and other support services, where necessary, both before and after the asylum interview, are made available;\r\n(k) That, should the application be rejected, the decision must be reasoned and the claimant should be able to appeal against it to a competent body;\r\n(l) That, in the context of durable solutions, the voluntary return home from exile of refugees and their sustainable reintegration in safety are carried out with dignity and the social and economic security of refugees are secured.50 States who recognized the refugee status of women claimants should ensure that local integration is performed on the basis of equality and non-discrimination and that women are treated with dignity."

Legislative provisions that appear gender neutral may in practice have a disproportionate and negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to nationality by women.

The prohibition of dual nationality in many nationality laws increases the likelihood of statelessness. In many instances, women are not allowed to transmit their nationality to their foreign husbands. Sex- and gender-based discrimination in nationality laws continues to have a significant and detrimental impact on the enjoyment by women and their children of their human rights. Gender inequality persists in the nationality laws and practices of a significant number of countries and can lead to women becoming stateless. Gender inequality can also render children stateless when their mothers are prevented, on an equal basis with fathers, from transmitting their nationality to their children. In this way, discrimination against women can lead to a cycle of statelessness that can be perpetuated from generation to generation."

Other requirements such as economic self-sufficiency or property ownership may also be more difficult for women to meet as individuals.

In the light of the foregoing, the Committee recommends that States parties that have not already done so:\r\n(a) Review and withdraw their reservations to article 9 of the Convention because they are incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention and thus impermissible under article 28 (2);\r\n(b) Review and reform their nationality laws to ensure equality of women and men with regard to the acquisition, changing and retention of nationality and to enable women to transmit their nationality to their children and to their foreign spouses and to ensure that any obstacles to practical implementation of such laws are removed, in full compliance with articles 1 to 3 and 9 of the Convention;\r\n(c) Repeal laws stipulating the automatic acquisition of nationality upon marriage or automatic loss of a woman’s nationality as a result of changes in the marital status or nationality of her husband;\r\n(d) Consider permitting dual nationality where women have married foreign men, and for the children born of such unions, especially in situations in which legal regimes providing for dual nationality may lead to statelessness;\r\n(e) Prevent statelessness through legislative provisions making the loss or renunciation of nationality contingent on possession or acquisition of another nationality, and allow reacquisition of nationality for women left stateless owing to the absence of such safeguards;\r\n(f) Promote awareness of recent legal and policy development granting women equal rights with men to acquire, change or retain their nationality or that enable women to confer their nationality to their children and their foreign spouses;\r\n(g) Address indirect discrimination in nationality laws that arise, for example, through naturalization requirements that may be more onerous for women to meet in practice than for men;\r\n(h) Ratify or accede to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness;\r\n(i) Refrain from adopting and implementing any measures that deprive women of their nationality and render them stateless;\r\n(j) Collaborate with UNHCR in relation to its work on the identification, reduction and prevention of statelessness and protection of stateless persons, in particular stateless women;\r\n(k) Collect, analyse and make available sex-disaggregated statistics on stateless persons within their respective territories;\r\n(l) Implement effective measures to ensure that women and girls have equal access to identity documentation, including proof of nationality;\r\n(m) Take measures to achieve the timely registration of all births and, in this regard, take measures to raise awareness, especially in rural and remote areas of their respective territories, of the importance of registering births to ensure that all children are registered and that girls benefit from the same rights as boys."
