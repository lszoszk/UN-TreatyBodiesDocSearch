The right to health extends “not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions, and access to health-related education and information, including on sexual and reproductive health (…) the participation of the population in all health-related decision-making at the community, national and international levels.” This holistic approach aligns with the text of Article 5(e)(iv): ‘public health’ focuses on prevention and control of disease and injury, the improvement of underlying and other determinants of health, and the quality of interaction between authorities, health-related professionals and the population. ‘Medical care’ integrates the right to timely and appropriate health goods and services and includes palliative, curative and rehabilitative health. ‘Social security and social services’, inextricably linked to societal efforts to improve the determinants of health, are strategic rights in eliminating racial discrimination in health."

States should ensure consistency with their obligations under the ICERD in the context of any other organization, including international and regional financial and development institutions. States should ensure effective and non-discriminatory access to preventive, curative and rehabilitative health facilities, goods and services and technologies. To this end, States must promote human rights-based development. States should not promote, condone or perpetuate policies and practices that establish, reinforce and are not aimed at removing barriers faced by groups exposed to racial discrimination in the enjoyment of the right to health."
