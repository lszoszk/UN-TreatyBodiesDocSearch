The right to work also contributes to the survival of individuals and to that of their family, and, insofar as work is freely chosen or accepted, to their development and recognition within the community. The right to work is recognized in several international and regional legal instruments. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights proclaims the right to work in a general sense in article 6, and explicitly develops the individual dimension of the right to work through the recognition in article 7 of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work, in particular safe working conditions. The collective dimension of the right to work is addressed in article 8 of the Covenant, which enunciates the right of all persons to form trade unions and to join the trade union of their choice and the right of trade unions to function freely. The Committee has drawn upon its own jurisprudence, and that of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other human rights treaty bodies, to develop the present general comment."

However, the Committee is aware that a value system known as ableism adversely affects the opportunities for many persons with disabilities to have meaningful work and employment. Ableism and its impact have been described as “a value system that considers certain typical characteristics of body and mind as essential for living a life of value. Based on strict standards of appearance, functioning and behaviour, ableist ways of thinking consider the disability experience as a misfortune that leads to suffering and disadvantage and invariably devalues human life.” The foundation of the medical and charity models of disability, ableism leads to social prejudice, inequality and discrimination against persons with disabilities, as it underpins legislation, policies and practices such as segregated employment – for example “sheltered workshops” – and can result in involuntary participation in the informal economy."

Persons with disabilities face high unemployment rates, lower wages, instability, lower standards in hiring conditions, and lack of accessibility of the work environment, and are also less likely than other persons to be appointed to managerial positions when they are formally employed. All such barriers are exacerbated for women with disabilities. Persons with disabilities are more likely to earn lower wages than other persons and are more likely to be in vulnerable employment, including being employed in the informal sector, being self-employed or engaging in part-time employment. Data and other evidence indicate that these differences particularly affect persons with disabilities on such grounds as age, gender, sex, ethnicity and place of residence."

Discriminatory or differential treatment and the exclusion of persons with disabilities are seen as the norm, legitimized by a medically-driven, incapacity approach to disability.

This concept reflects the jurisprudence of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in which that Committee has made reference to the principle of equality in connection with work and employment by persons with disabilities: it has noted that the right of all persons to the opportunity to gain their living by work that they freely choose or accept is not realized where the only real opportunity open to persons with disabilities is to work in segregated facilities, and considers that persons with disabilities should not be segregated in sheltered workshops.Article 27 (1), in expressly identifying these rights of persons with disabilities, clearly indicates that segregated employment settings are inconsistent with them."

The Committee has noted in its jurisprudence that to achieve de facto equality in terms of the Convention, States parties must ensure that there is no discrimination on the grounds of disability in connection to work and employment.

For example, if the only way to enter a public building for a job interview is by a set of stairs, candidates who use wheelchairs are put in an unequal position because they are unable to enter the building. Implied in the prohibition of indirect discrimination is an ongoing obligation to ensure accessibility through universal design in all situations."

Reasonable accommodation means those modifications, adjustments and support that are needed to ensure the equal enjoyment or exercise of a human right or fundamental freedom. For example, a public sector employee with a vision impairment who is not provided with the appropriate equipment to perform allocated tasks, such as a computer programme that magnifies text on a computer screen, has been denied reasonable accommodation. Other examples of reasonable accommodation include making information accessible to the individual with disabilities, modifying equipment, enabling work from home, ensuring that an interpreter is provided in meetings, reorganizing activities, rescheduling work or providing support personnel. To fall within the concept of reasonable accommodation, the changes need to be negotiated with the individual. The duty to provide reasonable accommodation is applicable from the moment that a request for such accommodation is received or the need becomes apparent. The Committee emphasizes that the duty to provide reasonable accommodation is different from the duty to ensure accessibility, which flows from the prohibition of indirect discrimination and is set out in articles 4 and 9 of the Convention. While both duties are aimed at guaranteeing accessibility, the duty to ensure accessibility through universal design or assistive technologies involves building accessibility into systems and processes without regard to the needs of a particular person with disabilities, for example, to have access to a building on an equal basis with others. The duty to provide reasonable accommodation, on the other hand, applies from the moment that a person with disabilities seeks to exercise their rights or requires access in non-accessible situations or environments."

The concepts of multiple and intersectional discrimination reflect the fact that individuals do not experience discrimination as members of a homogeneous group but, rather, as individuals with multidimensional layers of identities, statuses and life circumstances.

If necessary, specific measures should be taken to build awareness within the public sector, attract and recruit persons with disabilities and support public sector employees with disabilities, with the aim of reflecting the diversity of the community and benefiting from the lived experiences of persons with disabilities."

In some cases, available working conditions may be harmful to the health and well-being of persons with disabilities for reasons related to their disability. These individuals require reasonable accommodation through modifications to working conditions, and meaningful social protection and other support to ensure that they are not forced to perform work against their will. In other cases, persons with disabilities experience harm through discrimination caused by segregation, lack of equal remuneration for work of equal value and limited pathways to employment that is freely chosen, on an equal basis with others. The risk of coercion stems from the fact that persons with disabilities often face wider social vulnerability, lack of meaningful alternatives and relations of dependency or care that become exploitative. This risk needs to be taken into account for the purposes of understanding whether consent has been given. Even when consent has been given, attention should be paid to a wider context of exploitation or coercion.

When persons with disabilities are injured at work or when a person acquires a disability through work, it is essential that rehabilitation and return-to-work measures fully respect the choice and preferences of the person and are not used to promote employment in segregated work settings."

        "Text": "Persons with disabilities are entitled to social protection (art. 28) to cover the loss or lack of earnings due to the inability to obtain or maintain freely chosen employment on an equal basis with others. The social protection system must ensure adequate protection of unemployed workers with disabilities on an equal basis with others. The right to social protection extends to part-time workers with disabilities, casual workers with disabilities, seasonal workers with disabilities and self-employed persons with disabilities, and persons with disabilities working in the informal economy. Benefits should include the continuation of support payments until such time that it is clear that the employment is sustained, and cover periods of loss of earnings when employees with disabilities are requested not to report for work during a public health or other emergency. Where employment ceases, support payments should be immediately reinstated. Support payments related to essential disability-related expenses should be continued throughout employment, to ensure employment on an equal basis with others. The support provided should also cover individuals, including primary caregivers (who are overwhelmingly female) and relatives, who support persons with disabilities. Concepts such as “inability to work” and “fitness to work” are not components of the design of social protection systems. The diversity of personal circumstances, needs and barriers that persons with disabilities experience in seeking, retaining and returning to paid employment requires the design of flexible social protection systems that are responsive to individual situations."

        "Text": "Collective bargaining is a tool of fundamental importance in the formulation of employment policies. Trade union-related rights apply equally to workers with disabilities as to other workers. Article 27 (1) (c), read in conjunction with article 29, serves to emphasize the importance of the right of persons with disabilities to form their own organizations. If these organizations are to be effective in the promotion and protection of the economic and social interests of persons with disabilities, they should be consulted regularly by government bodies and others in relation to all matters affecting them. It may also be necessary for these organizations to be supported financially, so as to ensure their viability."

Appropriately disaggregated data also allows the identification of those working in the informal economy and of the barriers related to self-employment and entrepreneurship."
