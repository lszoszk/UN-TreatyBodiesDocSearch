There is scientific evidence that a large proportion of extreme weather events around the world are a result of human-caused changes to the climate. The human rights consequences of such disasters are apparent in the form of political and economic instability, growing inequality, declining food and water security and increased threats to health and livelihoods. Although climate change affects everyone, those countries and populations that have contributed the least to climate change, including people living in poverty, young people and future generations, are the most vulnerable to its impacts."

As a result of those inequalities, women and girls are more likely to be exposed to disaster-induced risks and losses relating to their livelihoods, and they are less able to adapt to changes in climatic conditions. Although climate change mitigation and adaptation programmes may provide new employment and livelihood opportunities in sectors such as agricultural production, sustainable urban development and clean energy, failure to address the structural barriers faced by women in gaining access to their rights will increase gender-based inequalities and intersecting forms of discrimination."

Women and girls in situations of conflict are particularly exposed to risks associated with disasters and climate change. The higher levels of mortality and morbidity among women during and following disasters are also a result of the inequalities that they face in gaining access to adequate health care, food and nutrition, water and sanitation, education, technology and information.

Specific measures to ensure the promotion and protection of the rights of women and girls with disabilities, women and girls belonging to indigenous and minority groups, lesbian, bisexual and transgender women and girls, intersex persons, older women and women and girls belonging to other marginalized groups should be explicitly included in health-care policies and standards relating to situations of disaster;\r\n(g) Ensure that training curricula for health workers, including in emergency services, incorporate comprehensive, mandatory, gender-responsive courses on women’s health and human rights, in particular gender-based violence. Health-care providers should be made aware of the linkages between increased disaster risk, climate change and the growing potential for public health emergencies as a result of shifting disease patterns.

There is evidence that the effects of food, land and water insecurity are not gender-neutral and that women are more likely to suffer from undernourishment and malnutrition in times of food scarcity. It has also been shown that women and girls, who are those with the primary responsibility for growing, gathering and preparing food and collecting fuel and water in many societies, are disproportionately affected by a lack of available, affordable, safe and accessible drinking water and fuel sources. The additional burden placed on women and girls by such climate-related resource scarcity drains time, causes physical hardship, increases exposure to the risk of violence and increases stress."

As a result of discriminatory laws and social norms, women have limited access to secure land tenure, and the farmland that they are allotted tends to be of inferior quality and more prone to flooding, erosion or other adverse climatic events. Owing to the increasing rate of out-migration among men in climate change-affected areas, women are left with the sole responsibility for farming, yet they do not possess the legal and socially recognized land ownership necessary to adapt to the changing climatic conditions effectively. Women are also indirectly affected by the impacts of weather-related events on the price of foodstuffs."
