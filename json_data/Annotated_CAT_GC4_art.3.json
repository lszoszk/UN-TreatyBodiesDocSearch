Such violations include, but are not limited to: (a) widespread use of torture and impunity of its perpetrators; (b) harassment and violence against minority groups; (c) situations conducive to genocide; (d) widespread gender-based violence; (e) widespread use of sentencing and imprisonment of persons exercising fundamental freedoms; and (f) situations of international and non-international armed conflicts."

Indications of personal risk may include, but are not limited to the complainant’s: (a) ethnic background; (b) political affiliation or political activities of the complainant and/or the complainant’s family members; (c) arrest and/or detention without guarantee of a fair treatment and trial; (d) sentence in absentia; (e) sexual orientation and gender identity; (f) desertion from the national armed forces or armed groups; (g) previous torture; (h) incommunicado detention or other form of arbitrary and illegal detention in the country of origin; (i) clandestine escape from the country of origin following threats of torture; (j) religious affiliation; (k) violations of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, including violations related to the prohibition of conversion to a religion that is different from the religion proclaimed as State religion and where such a conversion is prohibited and punished in law and in practice; (l) risk of expulsion to a third country where the person may be in danger of being subjected to torture; and (m) violence against women, including rape."
