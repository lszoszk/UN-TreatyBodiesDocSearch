States should transparently and explicitly focus on children’s rights when preparing, communicating and updating nationally determined contributions.[29] This obligation extends to other processes, including biennial transparency reports, international assessments and reviews and international consultations and analyses;[30]\r\n(b) States have an individual responsibility to mitigate climate change in order to fulfil their obligations under the Convention and international environmental law, including the commitment contained in the Paris Agreement to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2030.[31] Mitigation measures should reflect each State party’s fair share of the global effort to mitigate climate change, in the light of the total reductions necessary to protect against continuing and worsening violations of children’s rights. Each State, and all States working together, should continuously strengthen climate commitments in line with the highest possible ambition and their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities. High-income States should continue to take the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets, and all States should enhance their mitigation measures in the light of their different national circumstances in a manner that protects children’s rights to the maximum possible extent;[32]\r\n(c ) Successive mitigation measures and updated pledges should represent the efforts of States in a progression over time,[33] keeping in mind that the time frame for preventing catastrophic climate change and harm to children’s rights is shorter and requires urgent action;\r\n(d) Short-term mitigation measures should take into consideration the fact that delaying a rapid phase out of fossil fuels will result in higher cumulative emissions and thereby greater foreseeable harm to children’s rights; \r\n(e ) Mitigation measures cannot rely on removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in the future through unproven technologies.
