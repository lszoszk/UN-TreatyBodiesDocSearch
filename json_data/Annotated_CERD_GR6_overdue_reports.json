        "Text": "The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,\nRecognizing the fact that an impressive number of States has ratified, or acceded to, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,\nBearing in mind, however, that ratification alone does not enable the control system set up by the Convention to function effectively,\nRecalling that article 9 of the Convention obliges States parties to submit initial and periodic reports on the measures that give effect to the provisions of the Convention,\nStating that at present no less than 89 reports are overdue from 62 States, that 42 of those reports are overdue from 15 States, each with two or more outstanding reports, and that four initial reports which were due between 1973 and 1978 have not been received,\nNoting with regret that neither reminders sent through the Secretary-General to States parties nor the inclusion of the relevant information in the annual reports to the General Assembly has had the desired effect, in all cases,\nInvites the General Assembly:\n(a) To take note of the situation;\n(b) To use its authority in order to ensure that the Committee could more effectively fulfil its obligations under the Convention.
