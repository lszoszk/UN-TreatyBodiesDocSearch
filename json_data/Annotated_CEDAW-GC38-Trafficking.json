Often accompanied by other economic policies, such as reduction in government spending on social services and the privatization of public goods and services, regressive tax shifts and labour market reforms all severely hamper States’ abilities to implement social policies that form the basis for dismantling structural inequalities, including gender inequalities and violations of women’s human rights in various spheres. Reduced social expenditure further shifts the responsibilities for basic social services from the Government to women.

In mixed migration flow hotspots, appropriate and confidential spaces for carrying out identification by trained staff and interpreters, who can promptly assess indicators of vulnerability and provide adequate support, are lacking. Survivors are often reluctant to self-identify or to disclose who has trafficked them for fear of retaliation, owing to lack of information on the crime and where to report it and to fear of engaging with authorities, including fear of being detained, prosecuted, punished and deported.",
