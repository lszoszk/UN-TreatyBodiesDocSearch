        "Text": "The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women,\r\nRecalling International Labour Organization Convention No. 100 concerning Equal\r\nRemuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value, which has been ratified\r\nby a large majority of States parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women,\r\nRecalling also that it has considered 51 initial and 5 second periodic reports of States\r\nparties since 1983,\r\nConsidering that although reports of States parties indicate that, even though the principle\r\nof equal remuneration for work of equal value has been accepted in the legislation of many\r\ncountries, more remains to be done to ensure the application of that principle in practice, in order\r\nto overcome the gender-segregation in the labour market,\r\nRecommends to the States parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women that:\r\n1. In order to implement fully the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women, those States parties that have not yet ratified ILO Convention\r\nNo. 100 should be encouraged to do so;\r\n2. They should consider the study, development and adoption of job evaluation systems\r\nbased on gender-neutral criteria that would facilitate the comparison of the value of those jobs of\r\na different nature, in which women presently predominate, with those jobs in which men\r\npresently predominate, and they should include the results achieved in their reports to the\r\nCommittee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women;\r\n3. They should support, as far as practicable, the creation of implementation machinery\r\nand encourage the efforts of the parties to collective agreements, where they apply, to ensure the\r\napplication of the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value.",
