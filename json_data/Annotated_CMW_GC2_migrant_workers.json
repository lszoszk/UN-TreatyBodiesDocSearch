        "Text": "International sources estimate that between 10 and 15 per cent of the world’s international migrants are in an irregular situation, although the very nature of irregular migration makes it difficult to find reliable data on the scale of this phenomenon. While the economies of developing countries cannot absorb the large numbers of young men and, increasingly, women, seeking employment, population decline and ageing have reduced the labour force in developed countries, thereby generating a demand for low and middle-skilled migrant workers in many sectors of the economy. However, that demand has not been matched by a corresponding increase in regular migration channels. As a result, employers often resort to migrant workers in an irregular situation to fill the gaps."

        "Text": "As a deterrent for migrant workers and members of their families in an irregular situation to enter or stay on their territory, States increasingly resort to repressive measures, such as criminalization of irregular migration, administrative detention and expulsion. Criminalization of irregular migration fosters and promotes public perceptions that migrant workers and members of their families in an irregular situation are “illegal”, second-class individuals, or unfair competitors for jobs and social benefits, thereby fuelling anti-immigration public discourses, discrimination and xenophobia. Moreover, migrant workers and members of their families in an irregular situation generally live in fear of being reported to the immigration authorities by public service providers or other officials, or by private individuals, which limits their access to fundamental human rights, as well as their access to justice, and makes them more vulnerable to labour and other types of exploitation and abuse."

Specific rights of migrant workers that are either not explicitly protected in other human rights treaties include their protection against unauthorized confiscation or destruction of personal documents (art. 21), procedural safeguards in individual expulsion proceedings (art. 22) and the right to have recourse to consular or diplomatic protection and assistance (art. 23). Among the economic, social and cultural rights of all migrant workers, the right to respect for their cultural identity (art. 31) and the right to transfer their earnings and savings upon termination of their stay in the State of employment (art. 32) are Convention-specific.

Lastly, in formulating national laws and policies concerning labour migration and the protection of migrant workers in an irregular situation, States are also guided by ILO Convention No. 97 (1949) concerning Migration for Employment (Revised), Convention No. 143 (1975) concerning Migrations in Abusive Conditions and the Promotion of Equality of Opportunity and Treatment of Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions), and the accompanying Recommendations Nos. 86 and 151."

States parties shall therefore consider the possibility of regularizing the situation of such persons in each individual case, in accordance with applicable national legislation and bilateral or multilateral agreements, taking into account the circumstances of their entry, the duration of their stay and other relevant considerations, in particular those relating to their family situation (art. 69, para. 2).

States parties shall respect the prohibition of discrimination by ensuring that their laws, regulations and administrative practices do not discriminate against migrant workers and members of their families. The Committee is of the view that merely addressing de jure discrimination will not ensure de facto equality.

In order to respect the inherent dignity of migrant workers and members of their families who are deprived of their liberty, States parties are obliged to ensure adequate conditions in line with applicable international standards, including the provision of adequate sanitary, bathing and shower facilities; adequate food (including appropriate food for those observing religious dietary laws) and drinking water; the right to communicate with relatives and friends; access to qualified medical personnel, and adequate opportunities to practise their faith, for example. It also requires States parties to ensure that they are not subjected to any form of inhumane treatment, including sexual violence and abuse, by guards or other detainees or inmates. States parties must therefore:\n(a) Train supervisory and other staff;\n(b) Enable regular and independent monitoring of places where migrant workers are or may be deprived of their liberty;\n(c) Ensure that they have access to effective and independent complaint mechanisms, including access to legal counsel and interpreters;\n(d) Investigate complaints of torture and other forms of ill-treatment in places\nwhere migrant workers or members of their families are deprived of their liberty; and\n(e) Bring those responsible to justice."

The opportunity to settle claims, wages and other benefits must be effective in practice. Migrant workers often encounter problems pursuing legal claims in the State of employment once they have returned to their State of origin, including high litigation costs or difficulties providing evidence. Therefore, States parties should, whenever possible, grant migrant workers and their family members a reasonable period of time prior to their expulsion to claim wages and benefits. States parties should also consider time-bound or expedited legal proceedings to address such claims by migrant workers. In addition, States parties should conclude bilateral agreements so that migrant workers who return to their State of origin may have access to justice in the State of employment to file complaints about abuse and to claim unpaid wages and benefits."

In this respect, States parties shall provide objective reasons in each case in which the reimbursement of the said contributions is deemed impossible. A decision not to reimburse contributions made by a migrant worker or family member must not discriminate on the basis of his or her nationality or migration status. Furthermore, the Committee considers that a migrant worker’s entitlement to social security benefits should not be affected by a change in workplace."

        "Text": "The reference to “contributions” in article 27, paragraph 2, does not imply that “social security,” under article 27, paragraph 1, refers only to contributory social security schemes. Such a narrow reading would be contrary to article 9 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which recognizes “social security” as “including social insurance.” Recalling that article 9 of the Covenant applies to all migrant workers, regardless of their legal status and documentation, the Committee considers that “social security” in article 27 of the Convention also covers existing non-contributory social benefits, and that migrant workers in an irregular situation shall have access to such benefits on a non-discriminatory basis, to the extent that the applicable legislation of the State party concerned provides for such an entitlement."

        "Text": "Article 28 of the Convention provides for migrant workers and members of their families to have the right to receive any medical care that is urgently required for the preservation of their life or the avoidance of irreparable harm to their health on the basis of equality of treatment with nationals. Article 28, however, read together with other international human rights instruments, may create broader obligations for States parties to both instruments. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights provides for the right to the highest attainable standard of health for all persons. States parties are therefore obliged to ensure that all persons, irrespective of their migration status, have effective access to at least a minimum level of health care on a non-discriminatory basis. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights considers this to encompass primary health care, as well as preventive, curative and palliative health services. The Committee on the Rights of the Child holds that every migrant child is entitled to the same health care as nationals under article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. To that effect, States parties shall ensure, inter alia, that all migrant workers and members of their families have access to essential medicines and that migrant children are provided with immunization against the major infectious diseases. They shall ensure that migrant women have access to appropriate prenatal and postnatal health care, safe reproductive health services, and to emergency obstetric care."

Although medical care need not necessarily be free of charge, equality of treatment requires that the same rules for payment of fees or exemption from payment apply to migrant workers and members of their families as to nationals. States parties should prohibit the charging of excessive fees from migrant workers in an irregular situation or requiring immediate payment or proof of payment before the service is delivered. Urgent medical care should never be withheld due to the inability to pay. States parties should also ensure that migrant workers and members of their families are provided with information on the medical care provided and information about their health rights. States parties should also ensure that doctors and health professionals are provided with culturally sensitive training regarding health care for migrant workers and members of their families."

States parties should not use health care as an instrument of immigration control, which would effectively prevent migrant workers in an irregular situation from contacting public health care providers out of fear of deportation. Toward this end, States parties shall not require public health institutions to report or otherwise share data on the migration status of a patient to immigration authorities, and health care providers should also not be required to do so. Moreover, States parties shall not conduct immigration enforcement operations on or near facilities providing medical care, as this would limit migrant workers and members of their families from accessing such care."

        "Text": "Article 30 of the Convention protects the “basic right of access to education” of all children of migrant workers “on the basis of equality of treatment with nationals of the State concerned.” Article 30 also provides that access to public preschool educational institutions or schools shall be without prejudice to the migration status of the child concerned or parents of the child. The Committee, in accordance with article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, is of the view that States parties must provide free and compulsory primary education for all, including children of migrant workers, regardless of their migration status. As such, States parties have an obligation to eliminate all direct costs of schooling, such as school fees, as well as alleviate the adverse impact of indirect costs, such as expenses for school materials and uniforms. Access to secondary education by children of migrant workers must be ensured on the basis of equality of treatment with nationals. Accordingly, whenever children who are nationals have access to free secondary education, States parties must ensure equal access by children of migrant workers, irrespective of their migration status. Similarly, when States parties provide different forms of secondary education, including vocational education, they should also make them accessible to children of migrant workers. The same principle applies to free preschool education or to scholarship schemes. Therefore, whenever children who are nationals have access to free preschool education or scholarships, States parties must ensure equal access by children of migrant workers, irrespective of their migration status."

The principle of equality of treatment requires States parties to eliminate any discrimination against migrant children in their educational systems. States parties must therefore avoid segregated schooling and the application of different standards of treatment to children of migrant workers as well as eliminate any forms of discrimination against children of migrant workers in classrooms. States parties also need to ensure that effective programmes, policies and mechanisms are in place to prevent discrimination against these children."

States parties should also clearly inform school administrators, teachers and parents that they are not required to do so either and provide them with training on the educational rights of children of migrant workers."

Considering these two provisions together, along with article 29, paragraph 1 (c), of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which applies to all children, the Committee is of the view that States parties should also ensure access for children of migrant workers in an irregular situation to mother-tongue instruction if already available to children of migrant workers who are documented as having the same mother tongue."

        "Text": "Legal identity is often a prerequisite for access to a number of fundamental rights. Children of migrants in an irregular situation, particularly those born in a host State that does not recognize their existence, are vulnerable throughout their lives. States parties are obliged to ensure that children of migrant workers are registered soon after birth, irrespective of the migration status of their parents, and provided with birth certificates and other identity documents (art. 29). States parties shall not require migrant workers to present a residence permit in order to register a child, as this would effectively deprive migrant children in an irregular situation of their right to birth registration, which can also deny them access to education, health services, employment and other rights. Non-compliance by migrant workers with the obligation to register their children following birth should never justify their exclusion from education."
