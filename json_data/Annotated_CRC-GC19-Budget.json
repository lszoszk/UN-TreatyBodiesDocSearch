The messages from children to public budgetary decision makers included:\r\n(a) Plan well. There should be enough money in the budget to provide for all rights of children;\r\n(b) It is impossible for you to invest in us if you do not ask us what to invest in! We know; you should ask;\r\n(c) Do not forget to include children with special needs in your budgets;\r\n(d) Spend money fairly and wisely. Don’t spend our money on something that is useless — be efficient, save money;\r\n(e) Investing in children is a long-term investment, and it generates a lot, so remember to think of it;\r\n(f) Investment in our families is also an important way of securing our rights;\r\n(g) Make sure there is no corruption;\r\n(h) Recognize the rights of all citizens, both young and old, by listening to people’s opinions on matters of governance;\r\n(i) I would like the Government to be more accountable and transparent;\r\n(j) Publish records of how the money is spent;\r\n(k) Provide budget information to all children in ways that are easily understood and in media that are popular with children, like social media.",

It acknowledges the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development (2015) and Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2015). Those agendas address States’ management of resources related to international cooperation that affect children, such as programme, sector and budget support, South-South cooperation and interregional cooperation. The Committee recalls the statement of common understanding on human rights-based approaches to development cooperation and programming adopted by the United Nations Development Group (2003), the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness: Ownership, Harmonisation, Alignment, Results and Mutual Accountability (2005), the Accra Agenda for Action (2008), and the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (2011), which also address such management. In addition, the Committee is mindful of the potential relevance to the present general comment of existing and evolving national, regional and international standards related to public financial management, provided that such standards do not contradict the provisions of the Convention. Three examples are The International Handbook of Public Financial Management,5 which highlights effectiveness, efficiency and equity in public financial management, The Fiscal Transparency Code, adopted by the International Monetary Fund in 2014, which calls for comprehensiveness, clarity, reliability, timeliness and relevance in public reporting on past, present and future public finances to enhance fiscal management and accountability, and the Principles on Promoting Responsible Sovereign Lending and Borrowing, adopted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 2012.",

In relation to budgets, this means that the State shall refrain from interfering with the enjoyment of the rights of the child by, for example, discriminating against certain groups of children in budget decisions, or withdrawing funding or diverting resources away from existing programmes providing for children’s enjoyment of economic, social or cultural rights, except in the circumstances outlined in paragraph 31 below;\r\n(b) “Protect” means that States parties shall prevent third parties from interfering with rights guaranteed under the Convention and the Optional Protocols. In terms of public budgets, examples of possible such third parties are the business sector6 and regional or international financial institutions that might play a role in the different stages of the public budget process. The obligation to protect implies that States parties should seek to ensure that their revenue mobilization, budget allocation and expenditures are not interfered with or undermined by third parties. This will require States parties to regulate the role of such third parties, set up complaints mechanisms and systematically intervene in cases of infringement by them.\r\n(c) “Fulfil” requires States parties to take action to ensure the full realization of the rights of the child. States parties should:\r\n(i) Facilitate children’s rights by taking measures that enable and assist children to enjoy their rights. In a budgetary context, this includes equipping all levels and structures of the executive, legislature and judiciary with the resources and information required to advance the rights of all children in a comprehensive and sustainable manner. This involves putting in place measures to increase knowledge and understanding of the Convention and its Optional Protocols within State functions, and fostering a culture that respects, protects and fulfils children’s rights.\r\n(ii) Provide for children’s rights where States are unable, for reasons beyond their control, to realize those rights themselves by the means at their disposal. This obligation includes ensuring that reliable, disaggregated data and information are publicly available to assess and monitor the extent to which children are able to exercise their rights, for example, in different parts of the State.\r\n(iii) Promote children’s rights by ensuring that there is appropriate education and public awareness concerning budget decision-making processes and the impacts they have. In relation to budgets, this means mobilizing, allocating and spending sufficient funds to communicate and engage with children, their families and caregivers about budget-related decisions, including legislation, policies and programmes that affect them.
