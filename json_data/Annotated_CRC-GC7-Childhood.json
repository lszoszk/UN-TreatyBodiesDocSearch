In many cases, very little information has been offered about early childhood, with comments limited mainly to child mortality, birth registration and health care.  The Committee felt the need for a discussion on the broader implications of the Convention on the Rights of the Child for young children.  Accordingly, in 2004, the Committee devoted its day of general discussion to the theme “Implementing child rights in early childhood”.  This resulted in a set of recommendations (see CRC/C/143, sect. VII) as well as the decision to prepare a general comment on this important topic.  Through this general comment, the Committee wishes to encourage recognition that young children are holders of all rights enshrined in the Convention and that early childhood is a critical period for the realization of these rights.  The Committee’s working definition of “early childhood” is all young children:  at birth and throughout infancy; during the preschool years; as well as during the transition to school (see paragraph 4 below).",

These requirements can best be planned for within a framework of laws, policies and programmes for early childhood, including a plan for implementation and independent monitoring, for example through the appointment of a children’s rights commissioner, and through assessments of the impact of laws and policies on children (see general comment No. 2 (2002) on the role of independent human rights institutions, para. 19).",

The Committee notes the growing body of theory and research which confirms that young children are best understood as social actors whose survival, well being and development are dependent on and built around close relationships.  These relationships are normally with a small number of key people, most often parents, members of the extended family and peers, as well as caregivers and other early childhood professionals.  At the same time, research into the social and cultural dimensions of early childhood draws attention to the diverse ways in which early development is understood and enacted, including varying expectations of the young child and arrangements for his or her care and education.  A feature of modern societies is that increasing numbers of young children are growing up in multicultural communities and in contexts marked by rapid social change, where beliefs and expectations about young children are also changing, including through greater recognition of their rights.  States parties are encouraged to draw on beliefs and knowledge about early childhood in ways that are appropriate to local circumstances and changing practices, and respect traditional values, provided these are not discriminatory, (article 2 of the Convention) nor prejudicial to children’s health and well being (art. 24.3), nor against their best interests (art. 3).  Finally, research has highlighted the particular risks to young children from malnutrition, disease, poverty, neglect, social exclusion and a range of other adversities.  It shows that proper prevention and intervention strategies during early childhood have the potential to impact positively on young children’s current well being and future prospects.  Implementing child rights in early childhood is thus an effective way to help prevent personal, social and educational difficulties during middle childhood and adolescence (see general comment No. 4 (2003) on adolescent health and development).",

Young children growing up in especially difficult circumstances require particular attention (see section VI below).  The Committee reminds States parties (and others concerned) that the right to survival and development can only be implemented in a holistic manner, through the enforcement of all the other provisions of the Convention, including rights to health, adequate nutrition, social security, an adequate standard of living, a healthy and safe environment, education and play (arts. 24, 27, 28, 29 and 31), as well as through respect for the responsibilities of parents and the provision of assistance and quality services (arts. 5 and 18).

The Committee urges States parties to identify the implications of this principle for realizing rights in early childhood:\r\n(a) Article 2 means that young children in general must not be discriminated against on any grounds, for example where laws fail to offer equal protection against violence for all children, including young children.  Young children are especially at risk of discrimination because they are relatively powerless and depend on others for the realization of their rights;\r\n(b) Article 2 also means that particular groups of young children must not be discriminated against.  Discrimination may take the form of reduced levels of nutrition; inadequate care and attention; restricted opportunities for play, learning and education; or inhibition of free expression of feelings and views.  Discrimination may also be expressed through harsh treatment and unreasonable expectations, which may be exploitative or abusive.  For example:\r\n(i) Discrimination against girl children is a serious violation of rights, affecting their survival and all areas of their young lives as well as restricting their capacity to contribute positively to society.  They may be victims of selective abortion, genital mutilation, neglect and infanticide, including through inadequate feeding in infancy. They may be expected to undertake excessive family responsibilities and deprived of opportunities to participate in early childhood and primary education;\r\n(ii) Discrimination against children with disabilities reduces survival prospects and quality of life. These children are entitled to the care, nutrition, nurturance and encouragement offered other children. They may also require additional, special assistance in order to ensure their integration and the realization of their rights;\r\n(iii) Discrimination against children infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS deprives them of the help and support they most require. Discrimination may be found within public policies, in the provision of and access to services, as well as in everyday practices that violate these children’s rights (see also paragraph 27);\r\n(iv) Discrimination related to ethnic origin, class/caste, personal circumstances and lifestyle, or political and religious beliefs (of children or their parents) excludes children from full participation in society. It affects parents’ capacities to fulfil their responsibilities towards their children. It affects children’s opportunities and self esteem, as well as encouraging resentment and conflict among children and adults;\r\n(v) Young children who suffer multiple discrimination (e.g. related to ethnic origin, social and cultural status, gender and/or disabilities) are especially at risk.",

Article 12 states that the child has a right to express his or her views freely in all matters affecting the child, and to have them taken into account.  This right reinforces the status of the young child as an active participant in the promotion, protection and monitoring of their rights.  Respect for the young child’s agency   as a participant in family, community and society   is frequently overlooked, or rejected as inappropriate on the grounds of age and immaturity.  In many countries and regions, traditional beliefs have emphasized young children’s need for training and socialization.  They have been regarded as undeveloped, lacking even basic capacities for understanding, communicating and making choices.  They have been powerless within their families, and often voiceless and invisible within society.  The Committee wishes to emphasize that article 12 applies both to younger and to older children.  As holders of rights, even the youngest children are entitled to express their views, which should be “given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child” (art. 12.1).  Young children are acutely sensitive to their surroundings and very rapidly acquire understanding of the people, places and routines in their lives, along with awareness of their own unique identity.  They make choices and communicate their feelings, ideas and wishes in numerous ways, long before they are able to communicate through the conventions of spoken or written language.  In this regard:\r\n(a) The Committee encourages States parties to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the concept of the child as rights holder with freedom to express views and the right to be consulted in matters that affect him or her is implemented from the earliest stage in ways appropriate to the child’s capacities, best interests, and rights to protection from harmful experiences;\r\n(b) The right to express views and feelings should be anchored in the child’s daily life at home (including, when applicable, the extended family) and in his or her community; within the full range of early childhood health, care and education facilities, as well as in legal proceedings; and in the development of policies and services, including through research and consultations;\r\n(c) States parties should take all appropriate measures to promote the active involvement of parents, professionals and responsible authorities in the creation of opportunities for young children to progressively exercise their rights within their everyday activities in all relevant settings, including by providing training in the necessary skills.  To achieve the right of participation requires adults to adopt a child centred attitude, listening to young children and respecting their dignity and their individual points of view.  It also requires adults to show patience and creativity by adapting their expectations to a young child’s interests, levels of understanding and preferred ways of communicating.",

They are active social agents, who seek protection, nurturance and understanding from parents or other caregivers, which they require for their survival, growth and well being.  Newborn babies are able to recognize their parents (or other caregivers) very soon after birth, and they engage actively in non verbal communication.  Under normal circumstances, young children form strong mutual attachments with their parents or primary caregivers.  These relationships offer children physical and emotional security, as well as consistent care and attention.

Respecting young children’s evolving capacities is crucial for the realization of their rights, and especially significant during early childhood, because of the rapid transformations in children’s physical, cognitive, social and emotional functioning, from earliest infancy to the beginnings of schooling.  Article 5 contains the principle that parents (and others) have the responsibility to continually adjust the levels of support and guidance they offer to a child.  These adjustments take account of a child’s interests and wishes as well as the child’s capacities for autonomous decision making and comprehension of his or her best interests.  While a young child generally requires more guidance than an older child, it is important to take account of individual variations in the capacities of children of the same age and of their ways of reacting to situations.  Evolving capacities should be seen as a positive and enabling process, not an excuse for authoritarian practices that restrict children’s autonomy and self expression and which have traditionally been justified by pointing to children’s relative immaturity and their need for socialization.  Parents (and others) should be encouraged to offer “direction and guidance” in a child centred way, through dialogue and example, in ways that enhance young children’s capacities to exercise their rights, including their right to participation (art. 12) and their right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (art. 14).

States parties should respect the primacy of parents, mothers and fathers.  This includes the obligation not to separate children from their parents, unless it is in the child’s best interests (art. 9).  Young children are especially vulnerable to adverse consequences of separations because of their physical dependence on and emotional attachment to their parents/primary caregivers.  They are also less able to comprehend the circumstances of any separation.  Situations which are most likely to impact negatively on young children include neglect and deprivation of adequate parenting; parenting under acute material or psychological stress or impaired mental health; parenting in isolation; parenting which is inconsistent, involves conflict between parents or is abusive towards children; and situations where children experience disrupted relationships (including enforced separations), or where they are provided with low quality institutional care.  The Committee urges States parties to take all necessary steps to ensure that parents are able to take primary responsibility for their children; to support parents in fulfilling their responsibilities, including by reducing harmful deprivations, disruptions and distortions in children’s care; and to take action where young children’s well being may be at risk.

The Committee notes that in practice family patterns are variable and changing in many regions, as is the availability of informal networks of support for parents, with an overall trend towards greater diversity in family size, parental roles and arrangements for bringing up children.  These trends are especially significant for young children, whose physical, personal and psychological development is best provided for within a small number of consistent, caring relationships.  Typically, these relationships are with some combination of mother, father, siblings, grandparents and other members of the extended family, along with professional caregivers specialized in childcare and education.  The Committee acknowledges that each of these relationships can make a distinctive contribution to the fulfilment of children’s rights under the Convention and that a range of family patterns may be consistent with promoting children’s well being.  In some countries and regions, shifting social attitudes towards family, marriage and parenting are impacting on young children’s experiences of early childhood, for example following family separations and reformations.  Economic pressures also impact on young children, for example, where parents are forced to work far away from their families and their communities.  In other countries and regions, the illness and death of one or both parents or other kin due to HIV/AIDS is now a common feature of early childhood.  These and many other factors impact on parents’ capacities to fulfil their responsibilities towards children.

The Committee is concerned that insufficient account is taken of the resources, skills and personal commitment required of parents and others responsible for young children, especially in societies where early marriage and parenthood is still sanctioned as well as in societies with a high incidence of young, single parents.  Early childhood is the period of most extensive (and intensive) parental responsibilities related to all aspects of children’s well being covered by the Convention:  their survival, health, physical safety and emotional security, standards of living and care, opportunities for play and learning, and freedom of expression.  Accordingly, realizing children’s rights is in large measure dependent on the well being and resources available to those with responsibility for their care.  Recognizing these interdependencies is a sound starting point for planning assistance and services to parents, legal guardians and other caregivers.  For example:\r\n(a) An integrated approach would include interventions that impact indirectly on parents’ ability to promote the best interests of children (e.g. taxation and benefits, adequate housing, working hours) as well as those that have more immediate consequences (e.g. perinatal health services for mother and baby, parent education, home visitors);\r\n(b) Providing adequate assistance should take account of the new roles and skills required of parents, as well as the ways that demands and pressures shift during early childhood   for example, as children become more mobile, more verbally communicative, more socially competent, and as they begin to participate in programmes of care and education;\r\n(c) Assistance to parents will include provision of parenting education, parent counselling and other quality services for mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents and others who from time to time may be responsible for promoting the child’s best interests;\r\n(d) Assistance also includes offering support to parents and other family members in ways that encourage positive and sensitive relationships with young children and enhance understanding of children’s rights and best interests.",

Comprehensive services will be coordinated with the assistance provided to parents and will fully respect their responsibilities, as well as their circumstances and requirements (as in articles 5 and 18 of the Convention; see section IV above).

The Committee notes that provision for registration of all children at birth is still a major challenge for many countries and regions.

As a first step in ensuring the rights to survival, development and access to quality services for all children (art. 6), the Committee recommends that States parties take all necessary measures to ensure that all children are registered at birth.  This can be achieved through a universal, well managed registration system that is accessible to all and free of charge.  An effective system must be flexible and responsive to the circumstances of families, for example by providing mobile registration units where appropriate.  The Committee notes that children who are sick or disabled are less likely to be registered in some regions and emphasizes that all children should be registered at birth, without discrimination of any kind (art. 2).

Growing up in relative poverty undermines children’s well being, social inclusion and self esteem and reduces opportunities for learning and development.  Growing up in conditions of absolute poverty has even more serious consequences, threatening children’s survival and their health, as well as undermining the basic quality of life.  States parties are urged to implement systematic strategies to reduce poverty in early childhood as well as combat its negative effects on children’s well being.

Research evidence demonstrates the potential for quality education programmes to have a positive impact on young children’s successful transition to primary school, their educational progress and their long term social adjustment.

The Committee notes that insufficient attention has been given by States parties and others to the implementation of the provisions of article 31 of the Convention, which guarantees “the right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts”.  Play is one of the most distinctive features of early childhood.  Through play, children both enjoy and challenge their current capacities, whether they are playing alone or with others.  The value of creative play and exploratory learning is widely recognized in early childhood education.  Yet realizing the right to rest, leisure and play is often hindered by a shortage of opportunities for young children to meet, play and interact in child centred, secure, supportive, stimulating and stress free environments.  Children’s right to play space is especially at risk in many urban environments, where the design and density of housing, commercial centres and transport systems combine with noise, pollution and all manner of dangers to create a hazardous environment for young children.  Children’s right to play can also be frustrated by excessive domestic chores (especially affecting girls) or by competitive schooling.  Accordingly, the Committee appeals to States parties, non governmental organizations and private actors to identify and remove potential obstacles to the enjoyment of these rights by the youngest children, including as part of poverty reduction strategies.  Planning for towns, and leisure and play facilities should take account of children’s right to express their views (art. 12), through appropriate consultations.  In all these respects, States parties are encouraged to pay greater attention and allocate adequate resources (human and financial) to the implementation of the right to rest, leisure and play.",

        "Text": "Young children’s vulnerability to risks.  Throughout this general comment the Committee notes that large numbers of young children grow up in difficult circumstances that are frequently in violation of their rights.  Young children are especially vulnerable to the harm caused by unreliable, inconsistent relationships with parents and caregivers, or growing up in extreme poverty and deprivation, or being surrounded by conflict and violence or displaced from their homes as refugees, or any number of other adversities prejudicial to their well being.  Young children are less able to comprehend these adversities or resist harmful effects on their health, or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.  They are especially at risk where parents or other caregivers are unable to offer adequate protection, whether due to illness, or death, or due to disruption to families or communities.  Whatever the difficult circumstances, young children require particular consideration because of the rapid developmental changes they are experiencing; they are more vulnerable to disease, trauma, and distorted or disturbed development, and they are relatively powerless to avoid or resist difficulties and are dependent on others to offer protection and promote their best interests.  In the following paragraphs, the Committee draws States parties’ attention to major difficult circumstances referred to in the Convention that have clear implications for rights in early childhood.  This list is not exhaustive, and children may in any case be subject to multiple risks.  In general, the goal of States parties should be to ensure that every child, in every circumstance, receives adequate protection in fulfilment of their rights:\r\n(a) Abuse and neglect (art. 19).  Young children are frequent victims of neglect, maltreatment and abuse, including physical and mental violence.  Abuse very often happens within families, which can be especially destructive.  Young children are least able to avoid or resist, least able to comprehend what is happening and least able to seek the protection of others.  There is compelling evidence that trauma as a result of neglect and abuse has negative impacts on development, including, for the very youngest children, measurable effects on processes of brain maturation.  Bearing in mind the prevalence of abuse and neglect in early childhood and the evidence that it has long term repercussions, States parties should take all necessary measures to safeguard young children at risk and offer protection to victims of abuse, taking positive steps to support their recovery from trauma while avoiding stigmatization for the violations they have suffered;\r\n(b) Children without families (art. 20 and 21).  Children’s rights to development are at serious risk when they are orphaned, abandoned or deprived of family care or when they suffer long term disruptions to relationships or separations (e.g. due to natural disasters or other emergencies, epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, parental imprisonment, armed conflicts, wars and forced migration).  These adversities will impact on children differently depending on their personal resilience, their age and their circumstances, as well as the availability of wider sources of support and alternative care.  Research suggests that low quality institutional care is unlikely to promote healthy physical and psychological development and can have serious negative consequences for long term social adjustment, especially for children under 3 but also for children under 5 years old.  To the extent that alternative care is required, early placement in family based or family like care is more likely to produce positive outcomes for young children.  States parties are encouraged to invest in and support forms of alternative care that can ensure security, continuity of care and affection, and the opportunity for young children to form long term attachments based on mutual trust and respect, for example through fostering, adoption and support for members of extended families.  Where adoption is envisaged “the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration” (art. 21), not just “a primary consideration” (art. 3), systematically bearing in mind and respecting all relevant rights of the child and obligations of States parties set out elsewhere in the Convention and recalled in the present general comment;\r\n(c) Refugees (art. 22).  Young children who are refugees are most likely to be disoriented, having lost much that is familiar in their everyday surroundings and relationships.  They and their parents are entitled to equal access to health care, education and other services.  Children who are unaccompanied or separated from their families are especially at risk.  The Committee offers detailed guidance on the care and protection of these children in general comment No. 6 (2005) on the treatment of unaccompanied and separated children outside their country of origin;\r\n(d) Children with disabilities (art. 23).  Early childhood is the period during which disabilities are usually identified and the impact on children’s well being and development recognized.  Young children should never be institutionalized solely on the grounds of disability.  It is a priority to ensure that they have equal opportunities to participate fully in education and community life, including by the removal of barriers that impede the realization of their rights.  Young disabled children are entitled to appropriate specialist assistance, including support for their parents (or other caregivers).  Disabled children should at all times be treated with dignity and in ways that encourage their self reliance.  (See also the recommendations from the Committee’s 1997 day of general discussion on “The rights of children with disabilities” contained in document CRC/C/66.);\r\n(e) Harmful work (art. 32).  In some countries and regions, children are socialized to work from an early age, including in activities that are potentially hazardous, exploitative and damaging to their health, education and long term prospects.  For example, young children may be initiated into domestic work or agricultural labour, or assist parents or siblings engaged in hazardous activities.  Even very young babies may be vulnerable to economic exploitation, as when they are used or hired out for begging.  Exploitation of young children in the entertainment industry, including television, film, advertising and other modern media, is also a cause for concern.  States parties have particular responsibilities in relation to extreme forms of hazardous child labour identified in the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) of the ILO;\r\n(f) Substance abuse (art. 33).  While very young children are only rarely likely to be substance abusers, they may require specialist health care if born to alcohol  or drug addicted mothers, and protection where family members are abusers and they are at risk of exposure to drugs.  They may also suffer adverse consequences of alcohol or drug abuse on family living standards and quality of care, as well as being at risk of early initiation into substance abuse;\r\n(g) Sexual abuse and exploitation (art. 34).  Young children, especially girls, are vulnerable to early sexual abuse and exploitation within and outside families.  Young children in difficult circumstances are at particular risk, for example girl children employed as domestic workers.  Young children may also be victims of producers of pornography; this is covered by the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography of 2002;\r\n(h) Sale, trafficking and abduction of children (art. 35).  The Committee has frequently expressed concern about evidence of the sale and trafficking of abandoned and separated children for various purposes.  As far as the youngest age groups are concerned, these purposes can include adoption, particularly (though not solely) by foreigners.  In addition to the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption provides a framework and mechanism for preventing abuses in this sphere, and the Committee has therefore always consistently and strongly urged all States parties that recognize and/or permit adoption to ratify or accede to this treaty.  Universal birth registration, in addition to international cooperation, can help to combat this violation of rights;\r\n(i) Deviant behaviour and lawbreaking (art. 40).  Under no circumstances should young children (defined as under 8 years old; see paragraph 4) be included in legal definitions of minimum age of criminal responsibility.  Young children who misbehave or violate laws require sympathetic help and understanding, with the goal of increasing their capacities for personal control, social empathy and conflict resolution.  States parties should ensure that parents/caregivers are provided adequate support and training to fulfil their responsibilities (art. 18) and that young children have access to quality early childhood education and care, and (where appropriate) specialist guidance/therapies.",

        "Text": "Capacity building for research in early childhood.  The Committee noted earlier in this general comment that extensive research has been carried out on aspects of children’s health, growth, and cognitive, social and cultural development, on the influence of both positive and negative factors on their well being, and on the potential impact of early childhood care and education programmes.  Increasingly, research is also being carried out on early childhood from a human rights perspective, notably on ways that children’s participatory rights can be respected, including through their participation in the research process.  Theory and evidence from early childhood research has a great deal to offer in the development of policies and practices, as well as in the monitoring and evaluation of initiatives and the education and training of all responsible for the well being of young children.  But the Committee also draws attention to the limitations of current research, through its focus mainly on early childhood in a limited range of contexts and regions of the world.  As part of planning for early childhood, the Committee encourages States parties to develop national and local capacities for early childhood research, especially from a rights based perspective. ",

        "Text": "Training for rights in early childhood.  Knowledge and expertise about early childhood are not static but change over time.  This is due variously to social trends impacting on the lives of young children, their parents and other caregivers, changing policies and priorities for their care and education, innovations in childcare, curricula and pedagogy, as well as the emergence of new research.  Implementing child rights in early childhood sets challenges for all those responsible for children, as well as for children themselves as they gain an understanding of their role in their families, schools and communities.  States parties are encouraged to undertake systematic child rights training for children and their parents, as well as for all professionals working for and with children, in particular parliamentarians, judges, magistrates, lawyers, law enforcement officials, civil servants, personnel in institutions and places of detention for children, teachers, health personnel, social workers and local leaders.  Furthermore, the Committee urges States parties to conduct awareness raising campaigns for the public at large.",

Acknowledging the resource constraints affecting many States parties seeking to implement the comprehensive provisions outlined in this general comment, the Committee recommends that donor institutions, including the World Bank, other United Nations bodies and bilateral donors support early childhood development programmes financially and technically, and that it be one of their main targets in assisting sustainable development in countries receiving international assistance.  Effective international cooperation can also strengthen capacity building for early childhood, in terms of policy development, programme development, research and professional training.",

The Committee urges all States parties, inter governmental organizations, non governmental organizations, academics, professional groups and grass roots communities to continue advocating for the establishment of independent institutions on children’s rights and foster continuous, high level policy dialogues and research on the crucial importance of quality in early childhood, including dialogues at international, national, regional and local levels.",
