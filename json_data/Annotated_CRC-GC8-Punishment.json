The Committee aims to guide States parties in understanding the provisions of the Convention concerning the protection of children against all forms of violence.  This general comment focuses on corporal punishment and other cruel or degrading forms of punishment, which are currently very widely accepted and practised forms of violence against children."

In the view of the Committee, corporal punishment is invariably degrading.  In addition, there are other non-physical forms of punishment that are also cruel and degrading and thus incompatible with the Convention.

But it is also possible to include a provision in the civil code or family law, prohibiting the use of all forms of violence, including all corporal punishment.  Such a provision emphasizes that parents or other caretakers can no longer use any traditional defence that it is their right (“reasonably” or “moderately”) to use corporal punishment if they face prosecution under the criminal code.  Family law should also positively emphasize that parental responsibility includes providing appropriate direction and guidance to children without any form of violence."

The de minimis principle - that the law does not concern itself with trivial matters - ensures that minor assaults between adults only come to court in very exceptional circumstances; the same will be true of minor assaults on children.  States need to develop effective reporting and referral mechanisms.  While all reports of violence against children should be appropriately investigated and their protection from significant harm assured, the aim should be to stop parents from using violent or other cruel or degrading punishments through supportive and educational, not punitive, interventions."

It is the Committee’s view that prosecution and other formal interventions (for example, to remove the child or remove the perpetrator) should only proceed when they are regarded both as necessary to protect the child from significant harm and as being in the best interests of the affected child.  The affected child’s views should be given due weight, according to his or her age and maturity."

Where separation is deemed to be justified, alternatives to placement of the child outside the family should be considered, including removal of the perpetrator, suspended sentencing, and so on."

The threat to the perpetrator of other disciplinary action or dismissal should also act as a clear deterrent.  It is essential that the prohibition of all corporal punishment and other cruel or degrading punishment, and the sanctions that may be imposed if it is inflicted, should be well disseminated to children and to all those working with or for children in all settings.  Monitoring disciplinary systems and the treatment of children must be part of the sustained supervision of all institutions and placements which is required by the Convention.  Children and their representatives in all such placements must have immediate and confidential access to child-sensitive advice, advocacy and complaints procedures and ultimately to the courts, with necessary legal and other assistance.  In institutions, there should be a requirement to report and to review any violent incidents."

The Committee emphasizes that the Convention requires the elimination not only of corporal punishment but of all other cruel or degrading punishment of children.  It is not for the Convention to prescribe in detail how parents should relate to or guide their children.  But the Convention does provide a framework of principles to guide relationships both within the family, and between teachers, carers and others and children.  Children’s developmental needs must be respected.  Children learn from what adults do, not only from what adults say.  When the adults to whom a child most closely relates use violence and humiliation in their relationship with the child, they are demonstrating disrespect for human rights and teaching a potent and dangerous lesson that these are legitimate ways to seek to resolve conflict or change behaviour."

The child is not a possession of parents, nor of the State, nor simply an object of concern.  In this spirit, article 5 requires parents (or, where applicable, members of the extended family or community) to provide the child with appropriate direction and guidance, in a manner consistent with his/her evolving capacities, in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the Convention.  Article 18, which underlines the primary responsibility of parents, or legal guardians, for the upbringing and development of the child, states that “the best interests of the child will be their basic concern”.  Under article 12, States are required to assure children the right to express their views freely “in all matters affecting the child”, with the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with age and maturity.  This emphasizes the need for styles of parenting, caring and teaching that respect children’s participation rights.  In its general comment No. 1 on “The aims of education”, the Committee has emphasized the importance of developing education that is “child-centred, child-friendly and empowering”. "

Challenging traditional dependence on corporal punishment and other cruel or degrading forms of discipline requires sustained action.  The promotion of non-violent forms of parenting and education should be built into all the points of contact between the State and parents and children, in health, welfare and educational services, including early childhood institutions, day-care centres and schools.  It should also be integrated into the initial and in-service training of teachers and all those working with children in care and justice systems."
