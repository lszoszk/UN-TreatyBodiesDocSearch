Sustainable Development Goal 4 too affirms the value of inclusive, quality and equitable education. Inclusive education is central to achieving high-quality education for all learners, including those with disabilities, and for the development of inclusive, peaceful and fair societies. Furthermore, there is a powerful educational, social and economic case to be made. As reflected in the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the thematic study on the right of persons with disabilities to education, only inclusive education can provide both quality education and social development for persons with disabilities, and a guarantee of universality and non-discrimination in the right to education."

Exclusion occurs when students are directly or indirectly prevented from or denied access to education in any form. Segregation occurs when the education of students with disabilities is provided in separate environments designed or used to respond to a particular impairment or to various impairments, in isolation from students without disabilities. Integration is the process of placing persons with disabilities in existing mainstream educational institutions with the understanding that they can adjust to the standardized requirements of such institutions. Inclusion involves a process of systemic reform embodying changes and modifications in content, teaching methods, approaches, structures and strategies in education to overcome barriers with a vision serving to provide all students of the relevant age range with an equitable and participatory learning experience and the environment that best corresponds to their requirements and preferences. Placing students with disabilities within mainstream classes without accompanying structural changes to, for example, organization, curriculum and teaching and learning strategies, does not constitute inclusion. Furthermore, integration does not automatically guarantee the transition from segregation to inclusion."

Inclusive education offers flexible curricula and teaching and learning methods adapted to different strengths, requirements and learning styles. This approach implies the provision of support, reasonable accommodation and early intervention so that all learners are able to fulfil their potential. The focus is on learners’ capacities and aspirations rather than on content when planning teaching activities. The “whole person” approach aims at ending segregation within educational settings by ensuring inclusive classroom teaching in accessible learning environments with appropriate supports. The education system must provide a personalized educational response, rather than expect students to fit the system;\n(d)Supported teachers: all teachers and other staff receive the education and training they need to give them the core values and competencies to accommodate inclusive learning environments, which include teachers with disabilities. An inclusive culture provides an accessible and supportive environment that encourages working through collaboration, interaction and problem-solving;\n(e)Respect for and value of diversity: all members of the learning community are equally welcome and must be shown respect for diversity irrespective of disability, race, colour, sex, language, linguistic culture, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic, indigenous or social origin, property, birth, age or other status. All students must feel valued, respected, included and listened to. Effective measures to prevent abuse and bullying are in place. Inclusion takes an individual approach to students;\n(f)A learning-friendly environment: inclusive learning environments are accessible environments where everyone feels safe, supported, stimulated and able to express themselves and where there is a strong emphasis on involving students in building a positive school community. Recognition is afforded to the peer group in learning, building positive relationships, friendships and acceptance;\n(g)Effective transitions: learners with disabilities receive support to ensure the effective transition from learning at school to vocational and tertiary education and, finally, to work. Learners’ capacities and confidence are developed and learners receive reasonable accommodation, are treated with equality in assessments and examination procedures, and their capacities and attainments are certified on an equal basis with others;\n(h)Recognition of partnerships: teacher associations, student associations and federations, organizations of persons with disabilities, school boards, parent-teacher associations and other functioning school support groups, both formal and informal, are all encouraged to increase understanding and knowledge of disability. The involvement of parents or caregivers and the community is viewed as an asset that contributes resources and strengths. The relationship between the learning environment and the wider community must be recognized as a route towards inclusive societies;\n(i)Monitoring: as a continuing process, inclusive education must be monitored and evaluated on a regular basis to ensure that neither segregation nor integration are taking place, either formally or informally. According to article 33, monitoring should involve persons with disabilities, including children and persons with intensive support requirements, through their representative organizations, as well as parents or caregivers of children with disabilities, where appropriate. Disability-inclusive indicators must be developed and used in a manner consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development."

Support can also consist of a qualified learning support assistant, either on a shared or on a one-to-one basis, depending on the requirements of the student. Individualized education plans must address the transitions experienced by learners who move from segregated to mainstream settings and between levels of education. The effectiveness of such plans should be regularly monitored and evaluated with the direct involvement of the learner concerned. The nature of the provision must be determined in collaboration with the student, together, where appropriate, with the parents, caregivers or other third parties. The learner must have access to recourse mechanisms if the support is unavailable or inadequate."

Therefore, States parties should implement the following core rights with immediate effect:\n(a)Non-discrimination in all aspects of education and encompassing all internationally prohibited grounds of discrimination. States parties must ensure non-exclusion from education for persons with disabilities and eliminate structural disadvantages to achieve effective participation and equality for all persons with disabilities. They must urgently take steps to remove all legal, administrative and other forms of discrimination impeding the right of access to inclusive education. The adoption of affirmative action measures does not constitute a violation of the right to non‑discrimination with regard to education, so long as such measures do not lead to the maintenance of unequal or separate standards for different groups;\n(b)Reasonable accommodations to ensure non-exclusion from education for persons with disabilities. Failure to provide reasonable accommodation constitutes discrimination on the ground of disability;\n(c)Compulsory, free primary education available to all. States parties must take all appropriate measures to guarantee that right, on the basis of inclusion, to all children and youth with disabilities. The Committee urges States parties to ensure access to and completion of quality education for all children and youth to at least 12 years of free, publicly funded, inclusive and equitable quality primary and secondary education, of which at least nine years are compulsory, as well as access to quality education for out-of-school children and youth through a range of modalities, as outlined in the Education 2030 Framework for Action."

States parties must engage in a well-planned and structured process of de-institutionalization of persons with disabilities. Such a process must address: a managed transition setting out a defined time frame for the transition; the introduction of a legislative requirement to develop community based provision; the re-direction of funds and the introduction of multidisciplinary frameworks to support and strengthen community-based services; the provision of support for families; and collaboration and consultation with organizations representing persons with disabilities, including children with disabilities, as well as parents or caregivers. Pending the process of de-institutionalization, persons in institutional care settings should be given access to inclusive education with immediate effect by linking them with inclusive academic institutions in the community."

All such interventions must guarantee respect for the dignity and autonomy of the child. In line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including Sustainable Development Goal 4, States parties are urged to ensure access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education, together with the provision of support and training to parents and caregivers of young children with disabilities. If identified and supported early, young children with disabilities are more likely to transition smoothly into pre-primary and primary inclusive education settings. States parties must ensure coordination between all relevant ministries, authorities and bodies as well as organizations of persons with disabilities and other non-governmental partners."

Census, survey and administrative data, including data from the Education Management Information System, must capture information on students with disabilities, including those still living in institutional settings. States parties should also gather disaggregated data and evidence on the barriers that prevent persons with disabilities from having access to, remaining in and making progress in inclusive quality education to enable the adoption of effective measures to dismantle such barriers. Strategies must be adopted to overcome the exclusion of persons with disabilities from standard quantitative and qualitative data-gathering mechanisms, including when it results from parents’ reluctance to admit the existence of a child with a disability, the lack of birth registration and invisibility within institutions."

Such a process requires adaptations to both pre- and in-service training to achieve the appropriate skill levels in the shortest time possible, to facilitate the transition to an inclusive education system. All teachers must be provided with dedicated units/modules to prepare them to work in inclusive settings, as well as practical experiential learning settings where they can build the skills and confidence to solve problems through diverse inclusion challenges. The core content of teacher education must address a basic understanding of human diversity, growth and development, the human rights model of disability and inclusive pedagogy that enables teachers to identify students’ functional abilities (strengths, abilities and learning styles) to ensure their participation in inclusive educational environments. Teacher education should include learning about the use of appropriate augmentative and alternative modes, means and formats of communication such as Braille, large print, accessible multimedia, easyread, plain language, sign language and deaf culture, educational techniques and materials to support persons with disabilities. In addition, teachers need practical guidance and support in, among others: the provision of individualized instruction; teaching the same content using varied teaching methods to respond to the learning styles and unique abilities of each person; the development and use of individual educational plans to support specific learning requirements; and the introduction of a pedagogy centred on students’ educational objectives."

Such a system might include partnerships between neighbouring educational institutions, including universities, promoting collaborative practices, including team teaching, study groups, joint student assessment processes, peer support and exchange visits, as well as partnerships with civil society. Parents and caregivers of students with disabilities can, where appropriate, serve as partners in the development and implementation of learning programmes, including individualized education plans. They can play a significant role in advising and supporting teachers in the provision of support to individual students, but must never be a pre-requisite for admission into the education system. States parties should utilize all possible sources of support for teachers, including organizations representing persons with disabilities, learners with disabilities and local community members who can contribute significantly in the form of peer mentoring, partnering and problem-solving. Their involvement provides an additional resource in the classroom and serves to build links with local communities, breaking down barriers and rendering teachers more responsive and sensitive to strengths and requirements of students with disabilities."

Persons with disabilities, through their representative organizations, should be involved in both the determination of the indicators and in the collection of data and statistics. Structural indicators should measure barriers to inclusive education and not be limited merely to collecting data disaggregated by impairment. Process indicators, such as on changes to the accessibility of physical environments, curriculum adaptations or teacher training, will make it possible to monitor the progress of the transformation. Outcome indicators such as the percentage of students with disabilities in inclusive learning environments obtaining final official certification or diplomas or the percentage of students with disabilities admitted to secondary education, must also be established. States parties should also consider measuring the quality of education through, for example, the five dimensions recommended by UNESCO: respect for rights, equity, relevance, pertinence, efficiency and efficacy. Monitoring affirmative action measures such as quotas or incentives may also be considered."
