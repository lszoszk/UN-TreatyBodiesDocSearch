The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), as laid down in article 6, deals more comprehensively than any other instrument with this right. The right to work is essential for realizing other human rights and forms an inseparable and inherent part of human dignity. Every individual has the right to be able to work, allowing him/her to live in dignity. The right to work contributes at the same time to the survival of the individual and to that of his/her family, and insofar as work is freely chosen or accepted, to his/her development and recognition within the community."

The collective dimension of the right to work is addressed in article 8, which enunciates the right of everyone to form trade unions and join the trade union of his/her choice as well as the right of trade unions to function freely. When drafting article 6 of the Covenant, the Commission on Human Rights affirmed the need to recognize the right to work in a broad sense by laying down specific legal obligations rather than a simple philosophical principle. Article 6 defines the right to work in a general and non‑exhaustive manner. In article 6, paragraph 1, States parties recognize “the right to work, which includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely chooses or accepts, and will take appropriate steps to safeguard this right”. In paragraph 2, States parties recognize that “to achieve the full realization of this right” the steps to be taken “shall include technical and vocational guidance and training programmes, policies and techniques to achieve steady economic, social and cultural development and full and productive employment, under conditions safeguarding fundamental political and economic freedoms to the individual”."

The essence of these objectives is also reflected in article 23, paragraph 1, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since the adoption of the Covenant by the General Assembly in 1966, several universal and regional human rights instruments have recognized the right to work. At the universal level, the right to work is contained in article 8, paragraph 3 (a), of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Civil Rights (ICCPR); in article 5, paragraph (e) (i), of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; in article 11, paragraph 1 (a), of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; in article 32 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and in articles 11, 25, 26, 40, 52 and 54 of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Several regional instruments recognize the right to work in its general dimension, including the European Social Charter of 1961 and the Revised European Social Charter of 1996 (Part II, art. 1), the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (art. 15) and the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 6), and affirm the principle that respect for the right to work imposes on States parties an obligation to take measures aimed at the realization of full employment. Similarly, the right to work has been proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in the Declaration on Social Progress and Development, in its resolution 2542 (XXIV) of 11 December 1969 (art. 6)."

States parties must have specialized services to assist and support individuals in order to enable them to identify and find available employment;\r\n(b) Accessibility. The labour market must be open to everyone under the jurisdiction of States parties. Accessibility comprises three dimensions:\r\n- Under its article 2, paragraph 2, and article 3, the Covenant prohibits any discrimination in access to and maintenance of employment on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, physical or mental disability, health status (including HIV/AIDS), sexual orientation, or civil, political, social or other status, which has the intention or effect of impairing or nullifying exercise of the right to work on a basis of equality. According to article 2 of ILO Convention No. 111, States parties should “declare and pursue a national policy designed to promote, by methods appropriate to national conditions and practice, equality of opportunity and treatment in respect of employment and occupation, with a view to eliminating any discrimination in respect thereof”. Many measures, such as most strategies and programmes designed to eliminate employment‑related discrimination, as emphasized in paragraph 18 of general comment No. 14 (2000) on the right to the highest attainable standard of health, can be pursued with minimum resource implications through the adoption, modification or abrogation of legislation or the dissemination of information. The Committee recalls that, even in times of severe resource constraints, disadvantaged and marginalized individuals and groups must be protected by the adoption of relatively low‑cost targeted programmes;\r\n- Physical accessibility is one dimension of accessibility to employment as explained in paragraph 22 of general comment No. 5 on persons with disabilities;\r\n- Accessibility includes the right to seek, obtain and impart information on the means of gaining access to employment through the establishment of data networks on the employment market at the local, regional, national and international levels;\r\n(c) Acceptability and quality. Protection of the right to work has several components, notably the right of the worker to just and favourable conditions of work, in particular to safe working conditions, the right to form trade unions and the right freely to choose and accept work."

Violations of the right to work can occur through the direct action of States or State entities, or through the lack of adequate measures to promote employment. Violations through acts of omission occur, for example, when States parties do not regulate the activities of individuals or groups to prevent them from impeding the right of others to work.

In conformity with articles 22 and 23 of the Covenant, the ILO and the other specialized agencies of the United Nations, the World Bank, regional development banks, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and other relevant bodies within the United Nations system should cooperate effectively with States parties to implement the right to work at the national level, bearing in mind their own mandates. International financial institutions should pay greater attention to the protection of the right to work in their lending policies and credit agreements. In accordance with paragraph 9 of general comment No. 2 (1990), particular efforts should be made to ensure that the right to work is protected in all structural adjustment programmes.
