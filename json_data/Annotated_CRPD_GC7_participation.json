The close consultation and active involvement of persons with disabilities, through organizations of persons with disabilities and their partners, had a positive impact on the quality of the Convention and its relevance for such persons. It also showed the force, influence and potential of persons with disabilities, which resulted in a groundbreaking human rights treaty and established the human rights model of disability. The effective and meaningful participation of persons with disabilities, through their representative organizations, is thus at the heart of the Convention."

The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes participation as both a general obligation and a cross-cutting issue. In fact, it enshrines the obligation of States parties to closely consult and actively involve persons with disabilities (art. 4 (3)) and the participation of persons with disabilities in the monitoring process (art. 33 (3)) as part of a wider concept of participation in public life."

Ideally, there should be only one or two umbrella organizations at each level of decision-making. To be open, democratic and represent the full and wide diversity of persons with disabilities, they should accept all organizations of persons with disabilities as members. They should be organized, led and controlled by persons with disabilities. They only speak on behalf of their member organizations and solely on matters that are of mutual interest and collectively decided upon. However, they cannot represent individual persons with disabilities because they often lack detailed knowledge of personal backgrounds. Individual organizations of persons with disabilities representing specific communities are in a better position to play such a role. However, persons with disabilities should be able to decide for themselves which organizations they want to represent them. The existence of umbrella organizations within States parties should not, under any circumstances, hinder individuals or organizations of persons with disabilities from participating in consultations or other forms of promoting the interests of persons with disabilities;\n(b)Cross-disability organizations, which are composed of persons representing all or some of the wide diversity of impairments. They most frequently organize at the local and/or national levels, but can also exist at the regional and international levels;\n(c)Self-advocacy organizations representing persons with disabilities in different, often loosely and/or locally formed, networks and platforms. They advocate for the rights of persons with disabilities, especially persons with intellectual disabilities. Their establishment, with appropriate, sometimes extensive, support to enable their members to express their opinions, is of fundamental importance to political participation and participation in decision-making, monitoring and implementation processes. This is particularly relevant for persons who are prevented from exercising their legal capacity, institutionalized and/or denied the right to vote. In many countries, self-advocacy organizations are discriminated against through the refusal of a legal status because of laws and regulations that deny the legal capacity of their members;\n(d)Organizations including family members and/or relatives of persons with disabilities, which are pivotal in facilitating, promoting and securing the interests and supporting the autonomy and active participation of their relatives with intellectual disabilities, dementia and/or children with disabilities, when these groups of persons with disabilities want to be supported by their families as united networks or organizations. In such cases, these organizations should be included in consultation, decision-making and monitoring processes. The role of parents, relatives and caregivers in such organizations should be to assist and empower persons with disabilities to have a voice and take full control of their own lives. Such organizations should actively work to promote and use supported decision-making processes to ensure and respect the right of persons with disabilities to be consulted and to express their own views;\n(e)Organizations of women and girls with disabilities, which represent women and girls with disabilities as a heterogeneous group. The diversity of women and girls with disabilities should include all types of impairments. Ensuring the participation of women and girls with disabilities is indispensable in consultations addressing specific issues that exclusively or disproportionately affect women and girls with disabilities, and issues related to women and girls in general, such as gender equality policies;\n(f)Organizations and initiatives of children and young persons with disabilities, which are fundamental for the participation of children in public and community life and for their right to be heard and their freedom of expression and association. Adults have a key and supportive role to play in promoting an environment that enables children and young persons with disabilities to establish and act, formally or informally, within their own organizations and initiatives, including through cooperation with adults and other children and young persons."

This participation takes many forms and includes persons with disabilities assuming the roles of, for example, claimants, victims, defendants, judges, jurors and lawyers, as part of the democratic system that contributes to good governance. Close consultation with persons with disabilities through their representative organizations is key in all processes to enact and/or amend laws, regulations, policies and programmes addressing the participation of such persons in the justice system."

In accordance with article 33 (3), this means that regardless of whether the independent monitoring authority, which is assigned the task under article 16 (3), coincides with the independent monitoring framework under article 33 (2), civil society, including organizations of persons with disabilities, should be actively involved in monitoring those facilities and services."

States parties should, among others, take the following measures to ensure the full implementation of articles 4 (3) and 33 (3):\n(a)Repeal all laws, including those denying legal capacity, that prevent any person with disabilities, regardless of type of impairment, from being closely consulted with and actively involved, through their organizations of persons with disabilities;\n(b)Create an enabling environment for the establishment and functioning of organizations of persons with disabilities, by adopting a policy framework favourable to their establishment and sustained operation. This includes guaranteeing their independence and autonomy from the State, the establishment, implementation of and access to adequate funding mechanisms, including public funding and international cooperation, and the provision of support, including technical assistance, for empowerment and capacity-building;\n(c)Prohibit any practices of intimidation, harassment or reprisals against individuals and organizations promoting their rights under the Convention at the national and international levels. States parties should also adopt mechanisms for protecting persons with disabilities and their representative organizations against intimidation, harassment and reprisals, including when they cooperate with the Committee or other international bodies and human rights mechanisms;\n(d)Encourage the establishment of umbrella organizations of persons with disabilities, which coordinate and represent the activities of its members, and individual organizations of persons with disabilities with different impairments to ensure their inclusion and full participation, including those who are most underrepresented, in the monitoring process. If a State party faces obstacles in involving every individual organization of persons with disabilities in decision-making processes, they could include representatives of such organizations in permanent or temporary task forces etc., when it cannot be done through an umbrella organization or coalition of organizations of persons with disabilities;\n(e)Adopt legislation and policies that recognize the right to participation and involvement of organizations of persons with disabilities and regulations that establish clear procedures for consultations at all levels of authority and decision-making. This legislative and policy framework should provide for the mandatory realization of public hearings prior to the adoption of decisions, and include provisions requiring clear time frames, accessibility of consultations and an obligation to provide reasonable accommodation and support. This can be done through clear references in laws and other forms of regulations to the participation and selection of representatives from organizations of persons with disabilities;\n(f)Establish permanent consultation mechanisms with organizations of persons with disabilities, including round tables, participatory dialogues, public hearings, surveys and online consultations, respecting their diversity and autonomy, as indicated in paragraphs 11, 12 and 50. This can also take the form of a national advisory board, such as a representative national disability council representing organizations of persons with disabilities;\n(g)Guarantee and support the participation of persons with disabilities through organizations of persons with disabilities, reflecting a wide diversity of backgrounds, including birth and health status, age, race, sex, language, national, ethnic, indigenous or social origin, sexual orientation and gender identity, intersex variation, religious and political affiliation, migrant status, impairment groups or other status;\n(h)Engage with organizations of persons with disabilities that represent women and girls with disabilities and secure their direct participation in all processes of public decision-making in a safe environment, particularly relating to the development of policies regarding the rights of women and gender equality, and gender-based violence against women, including sexual violence and abuse;\n(i)Consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities, including children and women with disabilities, through their representative organizations, in the planning, execution, monitoring and measuring of public decision-making processes at all levels, especially in matters affecting them, including in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies, giving them reasonable and realistic timelines in providing their views and adequate funding and support;\n(j)Encourage and support the creation, capacity-building, funding and effective participation of organizations of persons with disabilities or groups of persons with disabilities, including parents and families of persons with disabilities in their supportive role, at all levels of decision-making. This includes at the local, national, regional (including within a regional integration organization) or international levels, in the conception, design, reform and implementation of policies and programmes;\n(k)Ensure monitoring of States parties’ compliance with articles 4 (3) and 33 (3), and facilitate organizations of persons with disabilities’ leadership in such monitoring;\n(l)Develop and implement, with the involvement of organizations of persons with disabilities, effective enforcement mechanisms, with meaningful sanctions and remedies, for non-compliance with State parties’ obligations under articles 4 (3) and 33 (3);\n(m)Ensure the provision of reasonable accommodation and the accessibility of all facilities, materials, meetings, calls for submissions, procedures and information and communication related to public decision-making, consultation and monitoring to all persons with disabilities, including persons isolated in institutions or psychiatric hospitals and persons with autism;\n(n)Provide disability and age-appropriate assistance for the participation of persons with disabilities, through their representative organizations, in public decision-making, consultation and monitoring processes. Develop strategies to ensure the participation of children with disabilities in consultation processes for the implementation of the Convention that are inclusive, child-friendly, transparent and respectful of their rights to freedom of expression and thought;\n(o)Conduct consultations and procedures in an open and transparent manner and understandable formats, inclusive of all organizations of persons with disabilities;\n(p)Ensure that organizations of persons with disabilities can receive and/or seek funding and other forms of resources from national and international sources, including private individuals and companies, civil society organizations, States parties and international organizations, including access to tax exemptions, and the national lottery;\n(q)Make existing consultation procedures in non-disability-specific areas of law accessible and inclusive of persons with disabilities, through their representative organizations;\n(r)Actively involve and closely consult with persons with disabilities, through their representative organizations, on public budgeting processes, the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals at the national level, international decision-making and international cooperation with other States parties, and adopt development policies that mainstream the rights and opinions of persons with disabilities when implementing and monitoring the 2030 Agenda at the national level;\n(s)Guarantee the participation, representation and easy access of persons with disabilities to focal points at all levels of Government and the coordination mechanisms, and their cooperation and representation within the independent monitoring frameworks;\n(t)Promote and ensure the participation and involvement of persons with disabilities, through their representative organizations, in international human rights mechanisms at the regional and global levels;\n(u)Define in close consultation with organizations of persons with disabilities verifiable indicators for good participation, concrete timelines and responsibilities for implementation and monitoring. Such participation can be measured, for example, by explaining the scope of their participation in connection with proposals for amending laws or reporting on the number of representatives from such organizations involved in decision-making processes."
