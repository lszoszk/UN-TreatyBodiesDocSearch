It is also an essential tool for personal development and for the development of an empowered workforce and citizenry that can contribute to civic responsibility and national development. In the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the General Assembly resolved to ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere would be able to complete a full course of primary schooling and that girls and boys would have equal access to all levels of education (resolution 55/2)."

The education of girls and women is considered to be one of the most effective investments for sustainable and inclusive development; however, in 2012, 32 million girls of primary school age around the world were out of school, representing 53 per cent of all out-of-school children, as were 31.6 million adolescent girls (50.2 per cent) of lower secondary school age. Even where educational opportunities are available, inequalities persist, preventing women and girls from fully taking advantage of such opportunities. In September 2013, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reported that 773.5 million adults (15 years of age or older) worldwide were illiterate, and 61.3 per cent of them were women, while among youth (15 to 24 years of age) 125.2 million were illiterate, with women and girls representing 61.3 per cent of that population. Girls and women are disproportionately discriminated against during the schooling process in terms of access, retention, completion, treatment and learning outcomes, as well as in career choices, resulting in disadvantage beyond schooling and the school environment."

In the Education 2030 Framework for Action, adopted on 4 November 2015 by the General Conference of UNESCO, and considered by the global education community as complementary to the Sustainable Development Goals, it is acknowledged that gender equality is inextricably linked to the right to education for all and that its achievement requires taking a rights-based approach, in order to ensure that all learners not only gain access to and complete education cycles, but are empowered equally in and through education."

The stratification of students and knowledge ultimately leads to girls being propelled into what are socially regarded as low-status occupations. Such stratification has the potential for further reinforcement in single-sex schools, where often the only subjects deemed suitable for the particular sex are offered.

Gender inequality is also manifested in unequal access to non-material status and power in teacher-student interactions. In educational settings, the way girls experience such inequality is influenced by several attributes, including their sex, socioeconomic status, race or ethnicity or belonging to a minority group, appearance and language patterns."

Sexual politics in schools refers to gender relations marked by unwarranted sexual overtones, such as the sexual harassment of girls in schools or on the way to and from school. They may be confronted with sexual harassment and abuse perpetrated by students, teachers and community members, as well as biased treatment in school. Sexual assault and other forms of gender-based violence in schools significantly contribute to low self-esteem, poor educational achievement and have adverse long-term effects on health and well-being. As a result of violence, girls are kept out of school, drop out of school or do not fully participate in school. Violence often begins with verbal insults and threatening gestures which, when not challenged by those in authority, are followed by violent acts."

Teachers should be specifically trained for the various levels of age-appropriate delivery. In situations where the teaching staff is predominantly male, such as at the secondary school level, efforts should be made to recruit, train and hire female teachers who can serve as role models and make classrooms safer and more enabling places for girls and young women."

Education equips individuals with the skills to be adaptable to the needs of changing societies and therefore has a multiplier effect in enabling women to claim rights in all spheres, beyond the school.

Women are underrepresented in decision-making positions at all levels of social and political institutions and lack real personal autonomy. Although increased access to education has improved the condition of women’s lives and that of their children, the potential for education, as it presently exists, to shift the overall balance of power in the economic, political and social spheres and to make a strategic difference in terms of the empowerment of women, has not been achieved, owing to cultural beliefs and practices that reproduce entrenched gendered ideologies, structures and systems."
