The Committee explicitly addressed the issue of racial profiling in its general recommendation No. 30 (2004) on discrimination against non-citizens, in which it recommended that States ensure that any measures taken in the fight against terrorism did not discriminate, in purpose or effect, on the grounds of race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin and that non-citizens were not subjected to racial or ethnic profiling or stereotyping (para. 10); in its general recommendation No. 31 (2005) on the prevention of racial discrimination in the administration and functioning of the criminal justice system, in which the Committee recommended that States parties take the necessary steps to prevent questioning, arrests and searches which are in reality based solely on the physical appearance of a person, that person’s colour or features or membership of a racial or ethnic group, or any profiling which exposes him or her to greater suspicion (para. 20); and in general recommendation No. 34 (2011) on racial discrimination against people of African descent, in which the Committee recommended that States take resolute action to counter any tendency to target, stigmatize, stereotype or profile people of African descent on the basis of race, by law enforcement officials, politicians and educators (para. 31). Other recommendations are also relevant to racial profiling, such as general recommendation No. 13 (1993) on the training of law enforcement officials in the protection of human rights, in which the Committee stressed that law enforcement officials should receive training to ensure they uphold the human rights of all persons without distinction as to race, colour or national or ethnic origin (para. 2); general recommendation No. 23 (1997) on the rights of indigenous peoples, in which the Committee stressed that indigenous peoples should be free from any discrimination, in particular that based on indigenous origin or identity (para. 4 (b)); general recommendation No. 27 (2000) on discrimination against Roma, in which the Committee recommended that States, taking into account their specific situations, take measures to prevent illegal use of force by police against Roma, particularly in connection with arrest and detention (para. 13), and to build trust between Roma communities and the police; general recommendation No. 32 (2009) on the meaning and scope of special measures in the Convention, in which the Committee mentioned the concept of “intersectionality”, whereby the Committee addressed situations of double or multiple discrimination – such as discrimination on grounds of gender or religion – when discrimination on such a ground appeared to exist in combination with a ground or grounds listed in article 1 of the Convention (para. 7); and general recommendation No. 35 (2013) on combating racist hate speech."

While aware that, in some areas, artificial intelligence can contribute to greater effectiveness in a number of decision-making processes, the Committee also realizes that there is a real risk of algorithmic bias when artificial intelligence is used in decision-making in the context of law enforcement. Algorithmic profiling raises serious concerns, and the consequences with regard to the rights of the victims could be very serious."

The Arab Human Rights Committee has submitted that racial profiling can be defined as the use by law enforcement agents of generalizations or stereotypes related to presumed race, colour, descent, nationality, place of birth, or national or ethnic origin – rather than objective evidence or individual behaviour – as a basis for identifying a particular individual as being, or having been, engaged in a criminal activity, resulting in discriminatory decision-making. In its general policy recommendation No. 11 on combating racism and racial discrimination in policing, adopted in 2007, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance defined racial profiling as the use by the police, with no objective and reasonable justification, of grounds such as race, colour, language, religion, nationality or national or ethnic origin in control, surveillance or investigative activities."

The prohibition on engaging in acts of racial profiling and the obligation to ensure that public authorities and institutions do not apply practices of racial profiling are furthermore derived from article 5 of the Convention. The practice of racial profiling is incompatible with the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law and to equal treatment.

In addition to being unlawful, racial profiling may also be ineffective and counterproductive as a general law enforcement tool. People who perceive that they have been subjected to discriminatory law enforcement actions tend to have less trust in law enforcement and, as a result, tend to be less willing to cooperate, thereby potentially limiting the effectiveness of law enforcement. Racial profiling practices influence daily routines of law enforcement and undermine, whether through conscious or unconscious actions, the capacity to support victims of crimes belonging to the affected communities.

Law enforcement agencies should ensure that in-service training to counter discrimination and bias-based policing is complemented by institutional interventions aimed at limiting discretion and increased oversight in areas vulnerable to stereotyping and biases. In addition, given concerns about the limitations of training on changing attitudes and behaviour, non-discrimination and bias training should be regularly evaluated and updated to ensure that it has the desired impact."
