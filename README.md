This Flask application, also available at <a href="https://lszoszk.pythonanywhere.com/">lszoszk.pythonanywhere.com</a>, is designed to perform in-depth analysis and search through a collection of the General Comments/Recommendations adopted by the UN Treaty Bodies. It offers functionalities such as keyword searching, concerned groups filtering, analysis of collocations and export search results to Excel.  üá∫üá≥ üîçüìäüìÑ

## Description

The app processes JSON data, enabling users to search through the General Comments/Recommendations (paragraph-level search) based on keywords, concerned groups/persons labels, and Treaty Bodies. It features an advanced text analysis pipeline using NLTK for tokenization, term frequencies, bigram extraction, and custom stopwords processing. The application also provide a search-within-search functionality, which allows for a more advanced filtering of search results.
